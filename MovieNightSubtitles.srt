2
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,582
So, it says here
that you were manager

3
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,487
of the Rusty Scupper
Restaurant for five years.

4
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,690
Hmm?
Then, a bank teller

5
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:17,597
at Bank of Oakland
between 2014 to 2016?

6
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,933
Oh! And you were
employee of the month.

7
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,603
What's that trophy
in the bag there?

8
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:29,740
Oh! Oakland High
Moot Court Champion.

9
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,210
I'm a salesman
at heart.

10
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:34,779
That is intriguing.

11
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,083
Mainly... because I was
the branch manager

12
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:43,688
at the Bank of Oakland
between 2014 and 2016.

13
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,324
And you, Mr. Green, you
never fucking worked there.

14
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:51,530
And the number that you gave to
The Rusty Scupper Restaurant?

15
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:53,734
Is that your friend
Salvador's number?

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,938
The same Salvador
who applied for this job?

17
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:04,877
I didn't know
he applied here, too.

18
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,579
Might have been helpful
if his outgoing message

19
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,849
didn't say,
"It's Sal, bitches."

20
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,652
This trophy and that
plaque, did you steal 'em?

21
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,389
No, uh, I...
made them.

22
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,790
Well, I had them... made.

23
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:22,697
Listen, I just really,
really need a job.

24
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,067
Okay, Cassius Green,
listen up, okay?

25
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,970
This is telemarketing.

26
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,439
We're not mappin'
the fuckin' human genome here.

27
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,875
I don't care if you have
experience for this.

28
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,544
I'll hire
damn near anyone.

29
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,845
You know what this
bootleg trophy tells me?

30
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:42,015
Tells me the only thing
I need to know.

31
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:44,587
You have initiative
and you can read.

32
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:50,023
You will call as many contacts
as you can during your shift,

33
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:52,559
you will read the script
that we give you,

34
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,729
and you will show up
tomorrow happy.

35
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:55,995
Hmm?

36
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:58,933
Thank you. Uh, thank you
so much, Mr. Anderson.

37
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,939
Ah, one more thing,
Cassius... "Stuss."

38
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,571
"Stuss"?

39
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:06,173
S.T.T.S.

40
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,708
Stick to the Script.

41
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,081
Stick to the script. Stick to the script.
You got it.

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,016
Thank you so much.

43
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:27,632
Troit!

44
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,835
Troit!

45
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:34,206
Troit!

46
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,814
You ever think about dying?

47
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,822
Yeah, I'm alive.
Sometimes.

48
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,622
No, I don't mean
like right now,

49
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,824
in a freak accident
or something.

50
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:59,633
I mean...
when we're old, like 90.

51
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:01,966
I think about it
all the time.

52
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,867
Like, what will
I have done that matters?

53
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,769
I just want to make sure
that when I die

54
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:08,872
I'll be surrounded
by people who love me

55
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,776
and who I love back.

56
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,112
But what about when they die?

57
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,314
What do you mean?

58
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:19,449
I mean, like at some
point we're gonna die.

59
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,688
Our kids are gonna die.
Our kids' kids are gonna die.

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,191
And at some point, no one
on Earth will have existed.

61
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:27,626
And at... at some point...

62
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,962
the sun will explode
and everyone will have died.

63
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,130
And no one will know
what I'm doing,

64
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:34,832
and what I'm doing right now
won't even matter.

65
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:38,068
Baby, baby it will
always matter, okay?

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,407
Because it matters now.
This moment, these moments.

67
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,476
When I kiss you...
it's not for posterity's sake.

68
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,646
Yeah, but... okay,
you got your calling.

69
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,747
Your art means
something, right?

70
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,550
But I'm just
out here surviving;

71
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,083
spinning around
on the endless circle.

72
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,353
- Ah, you missed your cue.
- That's disgusting.

73
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:58,256
I said, "When I kiss you,
it's not for posterity's sake."

74
00:04:58,258 --> 00:04:59,895
- Yeah, but...
- Mmm!

75
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,371
Oh, God!

76
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,180
- Get a room!
- I got a room, muthafucka!

77
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,880
I thought you said
you fixed that!

78
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,151
My landlord was supposed
to fix it.

79
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:25,919
I gotta move.

80
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,120
- Mmm!
- I like that.

81
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,831
I have to go
to work anyway.

82
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,701
- Don't you start work today?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:44,439
They said they hire anybody if
you're looking for a second job.

84
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,773
You could try part-time.

85
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:51,246
<i>Everyone is talking
about the Worryfree solution!</i>

86
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,547
<i>Worryfree is
a revolutionary new business</i>

87
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,249
<i>and lifestyle model
taking the world by storm!</i>

88
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,885
Baby, how much
are they paying you?

89
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,353
<i>When you sign a
Worryfree contract,</i>

90
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,289

00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,959
<i>Stop worrying

92
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:06,594
<i>The Worryfree living quarters

00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,529

00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:11,800
<i>and Worryfree careers are

95
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:14,405
Cash, baby,
what are they paying you?

96
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,372
Uh, I think
it's just commission.

97
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:19,444
Hey, baby...

98
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,414
you ever think
about this Worryfree shit?

99
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,047
Are you crazy?

100
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,919
What, working
on commission?

101
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,587
Nice earrings.

102
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,463
Hey, Cash!

103
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,232
I got overdue
house notes, dude.

104
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,900
How much longer I got
to wait for my money?

105
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,802
Look, Serge,
I just got a new job

106
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,605
and I'll have some money
for you soon.

107
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,339
Damn it, you four
months late now.

108
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,742
It's like "soon" is the only
fuckin' word I hear from you.

109
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,414
Okay, I'm four
months late, but...

110
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,048
Check this out. Damn.

111
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,848
God made this land
for all of us,

112
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,653
and greedy people like you want to
hog it to yourself and your family

113
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,021
and charge all the rest of
us for the right to live.

114
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,958
- Me and my family?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,928
Cassius,
I'm your fucking uncle.

116
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,861
The bank might
take my fucking house.

117
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,763
Four fucking months.

118
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,733
I gave you
that car you're driving.

119
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,767
- That's a damn bucket.
- Oh yeah?

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,841
Give it back then! No?

121
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,239
That's what I thought.

122
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,313
I need my money
in two weeks, asshole.

123
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,800
Hey.

124
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,102
Forty on two.

125
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,425

126
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,327

- <i>♫ All right ♫</i>

129
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,430

<i>♫ Oh yeah ♫</i>

00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,967

<i>♫ Hey ♫</i>

142
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,939
Millions of dollars
went into these walls

143
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:01,143
just to... make sure
that thousands of calls

144
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,879
can go out and in
at the same time

145
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:05,581
without jamming
the lines.

146
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,049
Log in here.
Grab a seat.

147
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:14,993
Come on.

148
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,330
You studied the script?

149
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,996
- Yeah.
- Look, clock in,

150
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:22,432
don't be lazy,

151
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,933
and I won't have
to be an asshole.

152
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:27,536
Make a sale, this light goes on.

153
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:29,172
You do real good,

154
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:34,378
eventually you might even be
able to be a Power Caller.

155
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,348
- A Power Caller?
- Where the callers are ballers.

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,754
Where they make
the real money.

157
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,725
They even have
their own elevator.

158
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,226
Oh yeah, I saw that.

159
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,595
Stick to the script.

160
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:13,721
What the fuck?

161
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:19,090
- Hello.
- Hey, Mr. Davidson.

162
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,095
Cassius Green here.
Sorry to bo...

163
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,397
Another one!

164
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,205
Hello?

165
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,039
Uh, this is Cassius Green.
Sorry to bother you.

166
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,209
I just wanted to mention
something else about

167
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:38,143
an encyc...
inside an encyclopedia.

168
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:47,120
Hello?

169
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,188
- Hi, Mrs. Costello.
- Yes.

170
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,823
This is Cassius Green.

171
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:54,593
I know that you've enjoyed our,
uh, series on birdwatching,

172
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:56,996
so I wanted to call
and... and help you out.

173
00:10:56,998 --> 00:11:00,569
I'm sorry, young man,
we don't have any money.

174
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:03,770
My husband's
in the hospital.

175
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,907
He's 73.
He's got stage 4 cancer.

176
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,253
Umm...

177
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,689
it's...

178
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:24,058
Oh, it's interesting that
you say that, Mrs. Costello,

179
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,794
because book number five
in the Insight series

180
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:29,563
is all about wellness, how to
stay healthy... on your own

181
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,833
without even going
to the doctor, so... so...

182
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,035
Damn it.

183
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,979
Really? You gonna stuff all those
French fries in your mouth?

184
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:53,557
I feel incompetent and like
an asshole doing this job.

185
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,129
I don't feel
any different.

186
00:11:58,764 --> 00:11:59,897
Hey.

187
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,797
That's that the dude
from that show.

188
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,667
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh shit!

189
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,936
That's fucking cool.
I hate that show.

190
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,339
But I never noticed
that, uh, room.

191
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,874
What... what is that?

192
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,442
The VIP room.

193
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:15,545
What the hell is a place like
this doing with a VIP room?

194
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,147
I used to be in there
all the time.

195
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,782
Well, what qualifies
a person to be VIP?

196
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,220
Well, you need
the password.

197
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:25,089
And this week
it's "upscale elegance."

198
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,325
Actually, every week is
"upscale elegance."

199
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,663
- I'm goin'.
- Where the fuck you going?

200
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:35,834
Yeah!

201
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,721
Fuck!

202
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,255
Ah!

203
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,230
That's some baller shit.

204
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:11,871
Hey! Mr., uh, D. Imits,
Cassius Green here.

205
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,839
Sorry to bother you. I just...

206
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:21,984
Hey, youngblood.

207
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,419
- What up?
- Lemme give you a tip.

208
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,224
Use your white voice.

209
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,892
- My white voice?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,292
Man, I ain't got
no white voice.

211
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:35,462
Oh, come on, you know
what I mean, youngblood.

212
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,766
You have a white voice in
there, you can use it.

213
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:41,968
It's like when you get
pulled over by the police.

214
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,938
Oh, no. I just use my regular
voice when that happens.

215
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,041
I just say, "Back the fuck up off
the car and don't nobody get hurt!"

216
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,243
All right, man, I'm just
trying to give you some game.

217
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,478
You wanna make
some money here?

218
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,750
Then read the script
with a white voice.

219
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,553
Well, people say I talk
with a white voice anyway,

220
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:00,120
so why it ain't
helping me out?

221
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,257
Well, you don't talk
white enough.

222
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,225
I'm not talkin'
bout Will Smith white.

223
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,826
That ain't white,
that's just proper.

224
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,964
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about the real deal.

225
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,398
Okay, so like...

226
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,200
"Hello, Mr. Everet.
Cassius Green here.

227
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:15,936
- Sorry to bother you"...
- Nah, man. Look, you got it wrong.

228
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,907
I'm not talking about sounding
all nasal.

229
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,711
It's, like, sounding like
you don't have a care.

230
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,648
Got your bills paid.
You're happy about your future.

231
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,985
You about ready to jump
in your Ferrari out there

232
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:30,518
after you get off this call.

233
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,355
Put some
real breath in there.

234
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:37,493
Breezy like... "I don't
really need this money."

235
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,427
You've never been fired.

236
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,599
Only laid off.

237
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,302
It's not really
a white voice.

238
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,603
It's what they wish
they sounded like.

239
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:52,842
So, it's like what they think
they're supposed to sound like.

240
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:55,144
Like this, youngblood.

241
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,480
Hey! Mr. Kramer!

242
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,782
This is Langston
from Regalview.

243
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,454
I didn't catch you
at the wrong time, did I?

244
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:06,457
If you're ever
gonna be a Power Caller,

245
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,094
you gotta know when to
bag ‘em and when to tag ‘em.

246
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:14,299
- Yeah?
- Hey. Um, what's baggin' and what's taggin'?

247
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,934
Bagging is when
you drop the call.

248
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:18,703
Like a dead body
into a bag,

249
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,872
you drop that shit
'cause it crossed the line.

250
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:25,543
Tagging is when
you claim that money.

251
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,312
It's a sale.
Cha-ching!

252
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:31,115
Like when they put the tag on the
body at the morgue to identify it.

253
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:32,517
That's mine.

254
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,921
Maybe you already bagged
that dead body, right?

255
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:39,291
And you're just about
to walk away, skip town,

256
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,925
lay low for a little while.

257
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:44,530
But instead, you drag
that heavy fucker

258
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:48,566
on out into the alley
and... then you tag it!

259
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,334
Okay. Uh, I... I just...

260
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:54,372
I feel like these metaphors have not
been cleared for this pep rally.

261
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:59,112
- Ah, okay. Diana?
- Oh! Yes.

262
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,947
Uh... hi. I'm new,

263
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:04,851
so forgive me for not knowing
everyone's name yet.

264
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,522
My name is Diana...

265
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:10,525
Dee-bo-sher-ree.

266
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,127
- That looks like "debauchery."
- Well, it's not.

267
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,662
Uh, I am your
new Team Leader!

268
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,197
And I know you're
looking at me going,

269
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,865
"Is she a manager?
I'm scared." Okay.

270
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:22,469
"She's going to treat me like a
system of motorized appendages!"

271
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,572
No, that stops here,
that stops right now.

272
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,307
You are not employees to me.

273
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,309
You are Team Members! We're a family now.
You know what that means?

274
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:32,280
It means I lean on you, you lean on me.
There's a synergy.

275
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,115
And you can feel that energy.
I know that you can.

276
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,518
People are starting to get
emotional, and I love that.

277
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,456
Does that mean
we get paid more?

278
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:44,293
"No." Okay, but what
is capital? Right?

279
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,761
I would argue that social
currency now is more important,

280
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:49,130
and don't take it from me,
take it from the news.

281
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,601
Take it from media, all kinds of
media: digital, paper, otherwise.

282
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,334
Media is changing,
so is capital.

283
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,804
Get with it. I don't want to
scare you, but it's a new world.

284
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:59,207
Okay, Team Members.
Let's, uh...

285
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,610
thank you very much, and
let's all get back to work.

286
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:05,347
Remember! Hit your contacts!
Up the ante!

287
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,616
Work the grid! And...

288
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:10,286
- Stick to the Script.
- That's right.

289
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:13,155
Any one of you can turn
Power Caller

290
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,561
and be rollin' in dough!

291
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,801
Oh, excuse me.

292
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,239
Ah. Okay.

293
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,846
Nothing in this office is free,
man, you gotta put money in there.

294
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:36,647
Oh, re... really?

295
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,048
It's okay, you're not missing out.
It tastes like shit.

296
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,119
Fuck. I thought
I could get lucky, asshole.

297
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:44,023
I was just giving you shit, man.
I'm... I'm Squeeze.

298
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,323
I've seen you around
for a couple weeks.

299
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,925
It was a good question
in there.

300
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:50,996
Cassius.
People call me Cash.

301
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,633
It was a really good
question in there, man.

302
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,667
- What, about us getting paid?
- Yeah.

303
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,636
I mean, I just think
it's kind of silly

304
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:00,405
that we have
to be all excited.

305
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:01,973
- I know, right?
- It's bullshit.

306
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:04,708
Exactly. I mean, you just cut
straight to the chase, man.

307
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,378
That's awesome.

308
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,247
A player gotta mob up
with us for some scrill and bennies.

309
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,950
Well, what the fuck
does that mean?

310
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:15,820
Uh, there's
a bunch of us

311
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:19,724
that are organizing
to get us paid more.

312
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,226
Get some benefits.

313
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:24,565
We could really use your
energy to jump things off.

314
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:28,033
Yeah, look, I gotta
get back to work, man.

315
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,770
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry
I got you like this,

316
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,072
but obviously
we can't talk here.

317
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:36,574
So, grab a drink later.
It's on me.

318
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:53,560
Hey, lady, how much?

319
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:57,229
- Okay.
- So, we good?

320
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,867
- Yeah.
- Alright.

321
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,105
- Hey.
- What up?

322
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,907
- Who are you?
- That's Squeeze.

323
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,243
- Squeeze.
- He works with us at Regalview.

324
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,478
Squeeze, Detroit.

325
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,813
- Detroit? That's cool.
- Yeah.

326
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:15,083
My parents wanted me to have
an American name.

327
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,484
Nice!

328
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,586
And Detroit is a brilliant
visual and performance artist...

329
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,022
No, my art is
not twirling signs.

330
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,890
...who's about to open
her first show.

331
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:26,727
Okay, "Mr. Embarrassing Intro Guy."

332
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:29,130
Squeeze, in high school,
Cash was...

333
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,698
Shit!

334
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Stuck... brake.

335
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,738
Why do you always talk about
what I did in high school?

336
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,910
I mean, like, look at our
high school football team.

337
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,245
Literally. Look at 'em.

338
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:46,215
All they do is work at the
home furniture store

339
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,950
and play football all day.

340
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,050
It's, like, they're stuck
or something.

00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:53,390
Man, what the hell you talkin' bout?
I mean, they're friends.

342
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,097
Baby, can you please not talk
about the sun exploding tonight?

343
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,198
Okay.

344
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,202
Yeah, but you know,
I... I just... at the end of the day

345
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,873
I just don't want to be
stuck in their position.

346
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,574
Ah, shit.

347
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,809
D, wiper duty, please.

348
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:16,480
Come on, man.
I never get wiper duty.

349
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,914
You can wipe my ass, Sal.

350
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,318
Oh, really? With what?
My tongue?

351
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,988
Well, shit, it might make your
breath smell a little bit better.

All I'm saying is if
you don't cook the spaghetti

382
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:43,870
in the sauce with the
cheese in it first,

383
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:47,339
- that's some white shit.
- That's some bullshit man.

384
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,976
You don't get to decide what's
black and what's white.

385
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,478
Well, that-that... but that's
how black folks do it, man.

386
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,349
- No, nigga, I'm black.
- We talked about that, man.

387
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:57,251
You kind of black,
you Lionel-Richie black.

388
00:21:57,253 --> 00:22:00,088
Look, I... I make my noodles,

389
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,290
then I put the sauce on,
then... look it,

390
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,024
then I put a little,
uh, Parmesan...

391
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:05,559
it doesn't even
fucking matter, alright,

392
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:06,994
'cause pasta
is from Italy.

393
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,161
Italians ain't white!

394
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,731
- Yes, they are, bro.
- Yes, they are!

395
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,498
Since the fuck when?

396
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,767
Since the last
60 years, man.

397
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,035
Spaghetti is Chinese.

398
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:18,071
Speaking of white,
I'm gonna make a toast.

399
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:19,543
- Come on.
- A'ight.

400
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:21,879
Okay.

401
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:28,050
To my esteemed
Regalview associates

402
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,753
whom I revere
with great fervor...

403
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,353
What?

404
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:36,260
...and to my alluring and
phenomenally talented fiancée...

405
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:40,595
I'd like to dedicate
this imbibing

406
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:42,331
of intoxicating elixirs.

407
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,435
Here's to becoming
a Power Caller!

408
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:55,144
Cassius,
how'd you do that?

409
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,781
Old man at the jobby-job.

410
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:58,948
It's called the white voice.

411
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,883
I guess I'm...
a natural at it.

412
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:03,085
That was all some
puppet-master voodoo shit!

413
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,554
Dude, you sounded
overdubbed.

414
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:07,290
Man, your white voice, man,
it's fucking scary.

415
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,192
Yeah, I've never seen
that shit before.

416
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:12,630
But I have heard about that Power
Caller shit that you're talking about.

417
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:13,664
That's a scam.

418
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,268
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

419
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,735
"If you work
hard enough as a fry cook,

420
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:19,902
maybe you can become
a manager!"

421
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:23,372
Or... or "If you twirl
that sign really well,

422
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:27,111
then maybe you can twirl a larger
sign on a more glamorous corner."

423
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:29,045
No, I already have
the best corner,

424
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:32,049
and the biggest sign,
and the best word. "Off."

425
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:33,785
It is the anchor to the slogan.

426
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,586
- So...
- So, what's the point then?

427
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:39,123
What you think, I'm just supposed
to work, eat, fuck, sleep?

428
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,462
No, I'm... I'm not saying that.
I'm saying what we need...

429
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,632
We need a union
at Regalview.

430
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,200
That way,
we all get paid.

431
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:51,902
Okay. Okay. Well said, broham.

432
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,607
I'm down.

433
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:01,646
- Hey, Cassius.
- Hey, Serg.

434
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,884
Uh, look, I get paid Friday, so
I'll have half your money by then.

435
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,318
Even if you had
all the money,

436
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,520
your little four month's
rent wouldn't help me.

437
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:09,922
I owe too much.

438
00:24:09,924 --> 00:24:11,724
If I don't come up
with a boatload of money

439
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,394
by next month...
which I won't...

440
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,028
the bank is
taking my shit.

441
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,933
You should find
a new place.

442
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:20,100
Damn.

443
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:22,604
It's making
my diabetes act up.

444
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:29,609
So, what you gonna do?

445
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:32,078
I've been talkin' to those
Worryfree people.

446
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,315
They sent me a brochure.
It don't sound that bad.

447
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:37,550
Three hots and a cot,
like we used to say.

448
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:40,186
- Oh, hell no, sir. Come on.
- No, don't... don't do that.

449
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,057
Look, we'll figure
something out.

450
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,692
Yes, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

451
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,661
Yeah, well, let me tell you.
I got a special for you.

452
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:49,563
Look, you bring a
chick home to your apartment.

453
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,465
It's clean. It's stylish.

454
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,166
Of course, it is.
She's already seen that

455
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,769
from the guy she
was with two weeks ago.

456
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,570
And then her eyes
move over

457
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,405
to those brown
leather bad boys

458
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:01,709
from the Insight Encyclopedias,
Intellectual Edition.

459
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:04,811
- It's fuck time! Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah!

460
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:07,117
Yeah! Holla, holla,
holla, holla, holla!

to chop it up more,

but I gotta get
to my squash game.

465
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,860
Was that Visa
or Mastercard?

466
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,466

Almost.

- Did you hear what he just said?
- Yeah, yeah, I heard him, man.

496
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,919
He told me the exact same
shit three months ago.

497
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,655
Nice earrings.

498
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,793

Mmm.

00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,707
- I'm gonna go dance, man.
- Alright. Yeah, motherfucka.

512
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,684
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm! No.

513
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:51,888
Give me the good stuff.

514
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,391
Give me the good stuff.

515
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:58,463
Yeah.

516
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,601
That's what
I'm talking about.

517
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:06,769
So, why you
ain't dancing' man?

518
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:09,439
Motherfucker, I'm too old
for that shit.

519
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,376
Man look, what happened to just
doing the muthafucking dog,

520
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:16,412
Umf-umf-umf-bow-wow.

521
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:19,549
You know I'm freakin,
you know what I'm saying?

522
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:23,520
Shit, now you got to dislocate
your muthafucking shoulder.

523
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:26,158
Damn, what the fuck
I look like doin that shit.

524
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:28,157
You, uh...

525
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,830
Hey. Power Callers, right?

526
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,029
They make a shit ton
of money, man.

527
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:36,133
I'm talking about, like, bins

528
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:39,368
and expensive house payment
type of money.

529
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,238
How the fuck is that
even possible?

530
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,742
If you selling the bullshit
we selling, it's impossible.

531
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:48,713
But they not selling the
bullshit we selling.

532
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,482
So, I guess comparing
to what we doing

533
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:53,952
to what they're doing
is like apples to oranges.

534
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:57,291
More like apples
and the Holocaust.

535
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,225
Alright. Bye.

536
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,137
Don't look into the light.

537
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:13,672
Fuckin' asshole.

538
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,108
- What up bro?
- What's up man?

539
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,977
- Good man.
- Aw, that hurt.

540
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:20,611
It's all good.
I've been telling

541
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:22,781
everybody how you've been kicking
all types of ass at work.

542
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:25,384
Yea. I mean it's crazy.
I'm finally...

543
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,019
feel like
I'm good at something.

544
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:28,287
I'm feeling myself.

545
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:30,455
- Word.
- I'm a fucking monster at this.

546
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:34,359
Man. That's awesome, man.

547
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:35,794
Fucking dope man.
That's awesome.

548
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:37,533
Yeah... whoa!

549
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:41,100
- Hey, Sugar Foot. Hey.
- Hey, Lovely.

550
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,337
- Can I get that?
- Who invited you?

551
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,038
Who asked you?

552
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,606
I was hoping
you'd pop up earlier.

553
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:48,007
I thought you
were coming by.

554
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,609
Oh, to your gallery?
I thought you said don't come.

555
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:52,145
Your friends
were helping you out.

556
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:55,448
Baby, that's what I said.
But don't listen to what I say.

557
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,650
Listen to what I want.

558
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:59,419
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, I know you are.

559
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:01,354
But are you gonna
pick me up on Friday?

560
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:03,357
- That's what I want.
- Is cash green?

561
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,961
Yeah. Cash is green.

562
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:09,565
- Can I get a light?
- No.

563
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:13,533
Those are nice earrings.

564
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:16,506
Wait, baby. I didn't know
you changed your earrings.

565
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,711
Detroit, I didn't know you made
earrings of your ex-boyfriends.

566
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:58,314
Alright, everybody.

567
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,583
This is a pretty amazing
turnout.

568
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:02,750
I hope you guys all know
that we're in this together.

569
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,587
That this is all of us,
ride or die.

570
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,591
You know what today is?

571
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:09,358
Today is the warning shot.

572
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,363
Telling them that
we stand united.

573
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:14,096
If we get this right today,

574
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:15,531
not only will it be our floor

575
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,934
but it will be every other floor
in Regalview and beyond.

576
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:21,939
A twenty-minute work stoppage
during prime calling time.

577
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:24,274
I'll give the call.
Sal what's the call?

578
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:26,309
Fuck you, pay me.

579
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,411
The other... other one.

580
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,880
Phones down.

581
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:31,615
Phones down.

582
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:33,351
Okay?

583
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:35,953
We hang up the phones.
Put down our headsets.

584
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:38,155
Now, they're gonna
single some of us out.

585
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,659
- Threaten our jobs.
- Fuck that.

586
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:43,326
- Yes, fuck that.
- Fuck that.

587
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:44,562
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck.

588
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:47,966
We ride for anyone
they try to fire.

589
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,467
We fight

590
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,570
because we make the profits
and they don't share.

591
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:55,039
If we're gonna
give them our day,

592
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,743
we need to have enough
to cover our basic necessities.

593
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,982
- Human decency.
- Yeah.

594
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:04,051
Is anyone not down?

595
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:06,719
Speak now.

596
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:08,723
Nah, fuck that, Squeeze!
We're ready!

597
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:10,759
Hmm?

598
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:14,993
Yeah. Uh, one for all.
All for one.

599
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:17,598
Yeah! I brought
all types of weapons.

600
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:22,301
Alright, folks. Let's meet back
here at 3:00 PM. Okay?

601
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:25,137
- Don't. It's not that serious.
- Okay, alright cool.

602
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:28,141
- It's like serious, but it's not that...
- But I'm ready though.

603
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:06,781
Thanks, Mr. Goldberg.

604
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:10,519
As always, we'll be getting
that out to you right away.

605
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,887
By the way...

606
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,559
Regalview management...

607
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,863
you are hereby warned.

608
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,867
We will not be overlooked.

609
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,206
Fucking God...

610
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:33,876
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

611
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,948
Phones down!

612
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,185
Fuck you! Fuck you!

613
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,187
And fuck you!

614
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,021
Fuck you, Regalview!

615
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,757
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

616
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,494
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

617
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,429
Fuck you, Regalview!

618
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:58,168
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

619
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,836
Fuck you, Regalview!

620
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,506
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

621
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,007
Fuck you, Regalview!

622
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,678
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

623
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,546
Fuck you, Regalview!

624
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,117
Fuck you,
Regalview!

625
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,196
Oh man!

626
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,939
Out, out, out,
out, out, out, out.

627
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,478
Alright, hey look,

628
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,182
I know you're gonna
threaten to fire me.

629
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,816
And go ahead whatever.
I don't care anymore

630
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:46,385
cause we're gonna
take this fuckin place...

631
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,891
Pack up your shit
and get out.

632
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:55,394
Well, fuck you and
fuck you and fuck you!

633
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,762
- What? No...
- Fuck you!

634
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:59,264
- Fuck you!
- No, no, no, no, no, no Mr. Green.

635
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,666
You're starting to sound
a little paranoid here.

636
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:04,103
We're the bearers
of good news.

637
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:05,237
Great news.

638
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,207
Great mothafuckin' news.

639
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:09,343
Great motherfucking news.

640
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,877
Power Caller.

641
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,013
- What the fuck...
- Yeah, we just got the call.

642
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:14,848
They think you're
A-1 material.

643
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,317
You're going upstairs
my <i>compadre.</i>

644
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,352
Yes. You are getting
a promotion.

645
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:22,589
9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

646
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:24,924
- Do you have a suit?
- Of course he does.

647
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:29,428
Powerful, young, strong,
intelligent Power Caller.

648
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,465
- But, but they, um...
- Oh, God.

649
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,034
They're gonna do what
they're gonna do.

650
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:34,869
You're not going
against their actions.

651
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,505
All their issues are down here.
Not up there.

652
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,242
Two very different
kinds of telemarketing.

653
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:44,915
But, but, oh, okay, um...

654
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,686
This is your moment.
Don't waste it.

655
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,225
Woo woo! Woo woo! Woo woo!

656
00:35:58,495 --> 00:35:59,763
Okay.

657
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,832
Maybe you're right.

658
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,202
The big money.

659
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:09,803
The top fucking tier
of telemarketing.

660
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:14,575
Making history with legends
like Hal Jameson.

661
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,246
Bad ass.

662
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:24,055
Oh, it's a really good batch,
so I hope you like France.

663
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,623
You should have some.

664
00:36:28,092 --> 00:36:30,428
- Should I just drink it right now?
- Yes!

665
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:34,096
Oh, yes!

666
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:38,400
- Because we didn't have any cups.
- Power Caller.

667
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:40,672
- Yeah!
- Yes!

668
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,441
Power Caller, baby.

669
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:47,010
- Power Caller, man!
- Power Caller!

670
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,681
Power Caller.
Power Caller.

671
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:05,396
Wow, you really are ready,
aren't you?

672
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:07,431
Hey, Ms. D. Yeah.

673
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,471
Wow, oh okay, well let's do
this, mu-tha-fuck-ah.

674
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:15,308
I've always wanted to say that.

675
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:19,543
Okay.

676
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:22,179
I would be remiss if I didn't
bring up your pink shirt.

677
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:25,616
I think it's extraordinary
and sexy.

678
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,052
You know, 35% of men
who wear pink

679
00:37:28,054 --> 00:37:31,423
are more likely
to start a franchise.

680
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,193
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

681
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:36,995
- Oh.
- Wow. Damn.

682
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:40,066
- This is crazy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

683
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,803
So clumsy.

684
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,987
Almost done...

685
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,759
this job's crazy right?

686
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,970
Do you need help with that?

687
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:24,481
Okay.

688
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,215
It's very secure.
It's very...

689
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:29,818
<i>Welcome, Power Caller.</i>

690
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,619
<i>Today is your day
to dominate the world.</i>

691
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,988
<i>You are Regalview's elite
brigade.</i>

692
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,726
<i>Take your place alongside
legends like Hal Jameson.</i>

693
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:40,929
<i>You call the shots.</i>

694
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,598
What...?

695
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,734
<i>You are in your sexual prime.</i>

696
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:48,205
<i>The top of the
reproductive pile.</i>

697
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,806
Alright, does it do
that every time━

698
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:56,111
Welcome to the
Power Calling Suite, Mr. Green.

699
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:58,180
White Voice
at all times here.

700
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:01,319
Yes, I almost forgot.

701
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,389
Good luck.

702
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,059
Nice suit, by the way.

703
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:10,693
You've been
selected, Mr. Green,

704
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:14,364
because you have the potential
to be a great telemarketer.

705
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,632
The potential.

706
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:17,333
Do you know
what we sell up here?

707
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,969
- Oh, I heard it's a...
- Ah, we sell power.

708
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:22,606
Firepower. Manpower.

709
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:26,842
When U.S. weapons manufacturers
sell arms to other countries

710
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:30,380
who do you think, Mr. Green, makes that
call at the precisely perfect time?

711
00:39:30,382 --> 00:39:33,019
- Which is of course, dinner.
- We do.

712
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:35,886
Before a drone
drops a bomb

713
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:38,321
on an apartment building
in Pakistan

714
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,390
who drops the
bomb ass sales pitch

715
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:41,627
you may ask, Cassius?

716
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:43,995
We do.

717
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:48,732
Okay, so you said
firepower, manpower?

718
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,401
Worryfree is our
biggest client.

719
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:54,873
We help thousands of companies
utilize Worryfree workers

720
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,911
to improve their efficiency.

721
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:01,579
So, wait, are you telling me
you sell slave labor

722
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:02,947
to companies over
the phone?

723
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:06,087
God damnit.
You are a sharp one.

724
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,677
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

725
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:32,514
Dave, stop him.

726
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:35,082
Shit!

727
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,220
Left Eye, bitches!

728
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:43,857
Worryfree has resuscitated
America.

729
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,525
Workers live in
space efficient dwellings

730
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,960
in the same facilities where
production occurs.

731
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:50,096
They make anything
and they make everything.

732
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:53,167
Lifetime contracts
so no wages needed.

733
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:59,005
They make automobiles for what it
used to cost to make bicycles.

734
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,875
Okay, but see
I don't know if I can...

735
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:02,576
Sugar on top, white voice.

736
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,311
Yeah, but what
I'm saying is I don't know

737
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:05,913
if I'm gonna be
able to s... sell...

738
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:08,986
Here's the starting salary.

739
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:15,291
Hmm?

740
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:21,396
Well, man, I'm gonna
have to get me some new suits.

741
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,263
You'll be working
here until late.

742
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:26,334
We need you
in the mix right away.

743
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,377
Hey baby, what's your sign?

744
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,315
I haven't heard that one before.

745
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,281
Yo, that was
crazy yesterday.

746
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,250
That was like that scene
in <i>Norma Rae.</i>

747
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,953
You know, the one when
she's like on the table.

748
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:45,389
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:49,193
Yeah, Regalview is scared shitless.
We'll win.

750
00:41:50,828 --> 00:41:52,263
Can I check that out?

751
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,733
Yeah.

752
00:41:58,436 --> 00:42:00,139
Oh, okay.

753
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:09,012
Okay. Bravo.

754
00:42:09,014 --> 00:42:10,579
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

755
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:11,715
Down in L.A.

756
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:15,952
We organized the first sign
twirlers union there.

757
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:17,954
Oh, okay.

758
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:19,323
Is that what you do?

759
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:21,725
You just go from place to
place stirring up trouble?

760
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:25,365
Trouble's already there.
I just help folks fix it.

761
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:29,834
Yeah, that's what I do with
my art too, you know.

762
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:31,502
Expose the bullshit.

763
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:34,872
- It's not exactly the same thing.
- It's pretty much the same.

764
00:42:34,874 --> 00:42:36,808
I haven't seen your stuff
so I can't...

765
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,812
I'm not gonna
show you my stuff.

766
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:43,418
So how does it work with, uh...

767
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:46,319
with you and Cassius?

768
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:49,791
You know,
you sound like a radical.

769
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:52,225
He's... I don't know.

770
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:56,197
He's what?

771
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:03,769
He's real.

772
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:06,137
He's not that fake-ass
bougie gallery world.

773
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,476
So, that's how it works.

774
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,617
Well, you're rubbing him off
right. So...

775
00:43:16,484 --> 00:43:19,285
He helped with the work
stoppage. So...

776
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:21,589
Your fire is rubbing off on him.

777
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:23,691
I like it.

778
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:26,658
I'm going.

779
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,294
You look like you're done here
if you need a ride.

780
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:33,168
Nah, Cassius' on the way.
But thank you.

781
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,277
Nice work.

782
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:55,756
Hey girl. We gotta go!

783
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,857
Thank you.

784
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:41,837
You okay?

785
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,972
Yeah.

786
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,608
- Did you get into an accident?
- No.

787
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,678
How about robbed or
something else crazy like that.

788
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,914
So, I don't think you flaked and
left me on a corner for an hour.

789
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:53,515
Yeah, I know. Look baby I was gonna
talk to you about it earlier

790
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:55,486
but I didn't know if it would be
a for sure thing or not.

791
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:58,854
But, as of today
I'm a Power Caller.

792
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:01,459
Does that mean you can
pay me back my $80?

793
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:04,528
Hell, yes, baby, of course I can.

794
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,864
Stop Cassius.
Stop, it's freaky.

795
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:09,502
What do they sell?

796
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:12,872
Am I finally gonna be able
to see your show?

797
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,741
Baby, this is beautiful.

798
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:19,476
And big.

799
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:20,781
Africa.

800
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,150
Oh, really, is that
what this is?

801
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:27,784
Yeah, I mean they're big
because they're Africa.

802
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:31,323
So, I added the sculptures
from last year.

803
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:34,059
Oh, okay. Well,
if nobody shows up

804
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:35,829
at least it'll look full.

805
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:38,530
Can I... can I ask a question?

806
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:41,067
Why did you choose Africa?

807
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:47,573
I wanted to talk about
a life shaped by exploitation.

808
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:51,577
About fighting for a say
in our own lives.

809
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:54,848
About how beauty,
love, and laughter

810
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,250
thrive and flourish under almost
any circumstances...

811
00:45:58,252 --> 00:45:59,585
Right.

812
00:45:59,587 --> 00:46:01,654
How Capitalism
basically started

813
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:04,324
by stealing
labor from Africans

814
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,426
and about how
you're nodding

815
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:07,759
like you're listening
but you're not.

816
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:11,297
Oh, no sorry baby.
I was receiving that.

817
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:14,500
I was just had a long day and...

818
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,136
- it's work.
- It's okay.

819
00:46:16,138 --> 00:46:17,870
You really want to hit this?

820
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:19,041
Yes.

821
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:29,215
Ah... yes, okay.
I'm listening now.

822
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:32,487
Capitalism in Africa
is booming.

823
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,356
Shh. I'm done talking.

824
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,992
I just want to
marinate in this.

825
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:40,494
This is major for me, Cash.

826
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:42,997
What I want to do is
I want sit here,

827
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:44,933
hit this weed

828
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,004
and just be here.

829
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:50,671
Alright guys. That
felt good the other day, right?

830
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:52,239
- Yes.
- Yes. Good, man.

831
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:54,308
Like I've known y'all
my whole life, you know.

832
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,243
Don't forget that. Okay?

833
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:58,314
Remember each other's faces.

834
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,383
Cassius? What's up man?
Where you been?

835
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,984
What's up with the suit?

836
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,518
I got promoted.

837
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,287
What does that mean?
Are you a manager now?

838
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,724
That means I'm
a Power Caller now.

839
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,594
- About to be paid.
- We're all trying to get fucking paid.

840
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,762
- Yeah.
- But we're gonna do it as a team.

841
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,264
- Are you on the team?
- Yeah, I guess I'm still on your little team

842
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,900
but I'm playing
from the bench.

843
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,668
The bench where you sit
and get your bills paid.

844
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,838
You know my uncle is
about to lose his house.

845
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,106
Cash, I'm sorry
about your uncle, man,

846
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:25,407
but that don't
mean sell out.

847
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,376
I'm not selling y'all out.

848
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,778
My success has nothing to do
with you, alright.

849
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,515
You just keep doing
whatever it is

850
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:33,818
that you're fucking doing
and I'll root for you.

851
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,685
From the sidelines.

852
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,189
And try not to laugh at that
stupid ass smirk on your face.

853
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,658
We don't need this.

854
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:43,260
- Are you doing alright?
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

855
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:44,660
- How you doing?
- Fantastic.

856
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:46,629
- Fantastic?
- I hope you have a good day.

857
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:47,930
I hope you have a better week.

858
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,267
I hope your month is full of
successful days.

859
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,836
And a lot of great ventures. I
hope you just come up, brother.

860
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:54,639
I hope your whole fucking year
is spectacular.

861
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:57,608
- Oh, you hope my year is spectacular?
- Yeah.

862
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,110
You got something
you want to say to me?

863
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:01,014
You got something
you want to say?

864
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:07,085
- You smell great.
- You smell great. What is that?

865
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:08,619
Burberry.
What you got on?

866
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,587
- I forgot. It's just deodorant.
- Smells expensive. Okay.

867
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:11,822
- Yeah. Good.
- We smelling good.

868
00:48:11,824 --> 00:48:13,558
Some good smelling
brothers out here.

869
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,226
You're an awesome man
and I appreciate you.

870
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,527
- I hope you find yourself.
- Yeah, we should go out. Get drinks.

871
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:18,830
- You want to get drinks?
- Yeah!

872
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:20,332
- How many drinks?
- Two. Three.

873
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:21,600
- Three? Five?
- Four! Five!

874
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:23,100
- Six? Eight?
- Seven! Nine!

875
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:24,303
- Ten? On me?
- All of them!

876
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:25,470
It's on me, no,
it's on me now!

877
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:26,771
- It's on you?
- Yeah, it's on me now.

878
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:29,108
- Alright. Alright!
- Yeah, it's on me!

879
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,845
- It's on you now.
- Now!

880
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,148
Walk!

881

<i>Greetings, Cassius Green.</i>

882
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:00,306
<i>I hope you did
not masturbate today.</i>

883
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:02,875
<i>We need you sharp
and ready to go.</i>

884
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:06,447
<i>I detect the pheromones
percolating out of your pores.</i>

885
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,249
<i>They say to others
around you:</i>

886
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:12,486
<i>"Hold my penis while I piss on
your underestimated expectations."</i>

887
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:15,222
<i>Mr. Green,
I am a computer</i>

888
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:18,925
<i>but I wish I had hands to
caress your muscular brain.</i>

889
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,796
Cassius Green, you've been
assigned a Worryfree campaign.

890
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:23,898
Brush up on that
Chapter Six stuff.

891
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,001
Excuse me.

892
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,269
And give them that
radiant voice of yours

893
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:31,172
in the next half hour.

894
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:32,406
2:00 PM.

895
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:34,909
Almost breakfast time in Japan.

896
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:38,582
Oh okay. Ah, doodily
doodily doodily doo.

897
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,967
- <i>Moshi moshi.</i>
- Mr. Son.

898
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:59,068
Cassius Green of Worryfree calling.
Sorry to bother you.

899
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,637
I'm calling about who
is assembling your phone.

900
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:03,673
Now I know they're
being made in China.

901
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,041
I'm a big fan of yours.

902
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,842
I've been following you
since you were with Takashi.

903
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:09,845
I cheered literally when
I found out you acquired Tanrio,

904
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:12,947
which is why I'm calling you
and not Phonarolla.

905
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,018
Mm-hmm.

906
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:18,689
Our team of
dedicated workers

907
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:21,457
will make twice as many phones
at half the cost.

908
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,493
You'll double up
your market share

909
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:24,895
over these bastards.

910
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,636
Power Callers, our
very own Cassius Green

911
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:33,536
just made our
client, Worryfree,

912
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:35,004
upwards of
ten million dollars

913
00:50:35,006 --> 00:50:37,808
in one call on his first day,
none the less.

914
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,743
- Oh, it's not that much.
- Indeed one for the history books.

915
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:42,582
Cheers!

916
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:46,184
Excuse me for a second.

917
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,684
What can I do for you, chum?

918
00:50:47,686 --> 00:50:49,219
Yes, I have a question.

919
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:52,356
I've just achieved a sort of
miraculous financial endeavor.

920
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:55,226
I'm also in
a financial bind.

921
00:50:55,228 --> 00:50:57,494
I'm gonna need a cash advance.

922
00:50:57,496 --> 00:50:58,765
Hmm.

923
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:37,833

Hey baby. Good morning.

00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:54,107
No. Please, no.

969
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:56,544
Stop with that
stupid voice, Cassius.

970
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:01,050
Didn't even realize I was doing it.

971
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,955
That's a problem, you know.

972
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:07,090
Sorry.

973
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,862
How long you been up?

974
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:13,964
I'm not up.

975
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:21,103
But I saw your TV debut.

976
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:22,607
Oh, shit.

977
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,876
- Cash, baby...
- Can we not. Please.

978
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:31,414
Look, I quit when
the strike jumped off

979
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:34,216
because being with you
made it awkward for me. But...

980
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:35,984
Cassius!

981
00:55:35,986 --> 00:55:38,153
You abandoned your friends.

982
00:55:38,155 --> 00:55:40,789
Baby, I thought they'd do a
couple of stoppages and...

983
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:42,524
It's one thing
to take the promotion,

984
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:44,294
but now you're
a full out scab.

985
00:55:44,296 --> 00:55:46,562
Come on, baby, the Power
Callers ain't on strike!

986
00:55:46,564 --> 00:55:48,263
No, but they should be.

987
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,533
I'm so tired of talking
to you about this.

988
00:55:50,535 --> 00:55:51,834
You are crossing
the picket line.

989
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:53,035
I can't ride with you.

990
00:55:53,037 --> 00:55:54,839
Oh, you can't
ride with me now!

991
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,306
But you was riding with me
all around over...

992
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:59,043
Alright, fine.
Well, no more.

993
00:55:59,045 --> 00:56:01,444
Baby, what are you
asking me to do?

994
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:03,614
Are you asking me to quit
the fattest job I ever had?

995
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:05,081
But Cassius, it's not fat!

996
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,654
It is morally emaciated.

997
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:10,587
You sell fucking slave labor,
Cassius!

998
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:12,190
What the fuck
isn't slave labor?

999
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:13,824
Oh my god! Side-stepping.

1000
00:56:13,826 --> 00:56:16,029
- You side-step more than the fucking Temptations.
- What isn't?

1001
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:20,966
Fuck you, man!

1002
00:56:20,968 --> 00:56:22,100
Fuck you, alright!

1003
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:23,334
Fuck you ‘cause
I'm doing something

1004
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:24,702
that I'm really
fucking good at.

1005
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:26,137
I'm really good at it
and I'm important.

1006
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:27,338
I'm making shit happen.

1007
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,807
And you don't
appreciate the shit

1008
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,008
cause you already
fucking had it.

1009
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,642
And you're talking to me
about slave labor?

1010
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:33,477
What is Squeeze and them
gonna do about slave labor?

1011
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:34,945
What does Squeeze
have to do with this?

1012
00:56:34,947 --> 00:56:36,383
They ain't gonna do shit.

1013
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,749
And you ain't
gonna do shit neither

1014
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:41,452
by selling fucking art
to rich people.

1015
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:42,658
Fuck it.

1016
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,196
Gimme the damn covers!

1017
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:50,362
- What you doing?
- Taking them.

1018
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:51,964
- I'm cold.
- I'm not playing Cassius.

1019
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:53,565
- You're being greedy.
- Don't play with me Cassius.

1020
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:57,238
You don't even need all those covers.
It's not necessary.

1021
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:11,552
The whole reason I went
to work for Regalview

1022
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:13,990
was to make myself
more interesting to you.

1023
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:19,362
Cassius, the old you
was way more interesting.

1024
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:24,898
If you go to work
today at Regalview

1025
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,369
crossing the picket line...

1026
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:29,971
we're done.

1027
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:34,979
Elbows and assholes, people!
Let's go!

1028
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:42,317
Chisels or dynamite, Cassius.
You pick.

1029
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,319
Yeah, agreed.
I just have to follow up

1030
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:46,023
on this lead
I've been working on.

1031
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:01,103
This motherfucker right here...

1032
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:03,371
is on fire!

1033
00:58:03,373 --> 00:58:05,907
Let's give it up
for the boy wonder!

1034
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:09,979
Yeah, yeah! Some for the homeys.

1035
00:58:09,981 --> 00:58:11,313
And some for me!

1036
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:13,782
Bag them, tag them, rag them!

1037
00:58:13,784 --> 00:58:15,249
I trained her. I trained her.

1038
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:19,388
We hunted mammoths! Yeah!

1039
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,328
Douse him. Douse
our winner with champagne.

1040
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,887
Scabs won't pass!

1041
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:52,690
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1042
00:58:52,692 --> 00:58:54,291
Scabs won't pass!

1043
00:58:54,293 --> 00:58:57,196
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1044
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:00,300
Move!

1045
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:05,204
I said get back!

1046
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:09,107
Have a cola and smile, bitch!

1047
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:16,982
Thank you very much, Miss Welcrott.

1048
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:19,151
I'll talk to you soon.
Mm-hmm.

1049
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:20,555
Okay, bye.

1050
00:59:21,988 --> 00:59:23,520
You, my friend,

1051
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:27,459
you are the best decision
I've made in quite a long time.

1052
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:29,060
I have to pat myself
on the ass for that.

1053
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:31,864
Thank you, Mister...

1054
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:33,933
Feels good
to be appreciated.

1055
00:59:33,935 --> 00:59:37,003
Don't call me Mr...,
Cassius.

1056
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:38,404
Call me...

1057
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,607
Million-dollar question
for you, Cassius.

1058
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:43,009
Do you like to party?

1059
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,344
I like parties.

1060
00:59:45,346 --> 00:59:46,913
What are you
doing tonight?

1061
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:48,380
Oh, I got this thing.

1062
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:50,549
Well my girlfriend,
ex-girlfriend...

1063
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:51,686
Fudge all that.

1064
00:59:58,593 --> 01:00:00,059
Hmm!

1065
01:00:00,061 --> 01:00:02,129
Steve Lift is throwing
his yearly party.

1066
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,530
Wants to see
our new star there.

1067
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:05,166
Wants to talk to you, Cassius.

1068
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,236
I have been waiting years
for this invite.

1069
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,470
Even Jay and Bey
can't get this invite.

1070
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:14,240
Hell yeah. I just got to do
this other thing.

1071
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:15,742
You go to your other thing.

1072
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:18,513
And I'll be there waiting.
Pick you up.

1073
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,252
This is the kind of party
that could change your life.

1074
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,870
Beauty, love, and laughter.

1075
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:48,910
I realize you were asking
about specific... that one.

1076
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:50,447
Yes...

1077
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:02,326
You know what, will you please
excuse me just one minute?

1078
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:11,634
- Hey.
- Hey.

1079
01:01:11,636 --> 01:01:14,103
I wouldn't miss this
for the world, you know.

1080
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:15,839
It's beautiful.

1081
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:17,873
- You're beautiful.
- Cash...

1082
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,176
I love you too...

1083
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:21,911
but I can't hang with
what I see in you now.

1084
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,647
What happened to your head?

1085
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:24,717
Oh, um...

1086
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:27,951
Oh, just... shaving...

1087
01:01:27,953 --> 01:01:30,688
Alright, I have to go get ready
for my performance.

1088
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,624
You should really stay
and see it, okay?

1089
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,525
Okay, but I can only stay
for a little while, baby,

1090
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:36,994
cause there's this party I got
to get back to. It's important.

1091
01:01:36,996 --> 01:01:38,496
A Slave auctioneers party?

1092
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:41,298
- Hey.
- Yo, what's up?

1093
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,432
Thank you for coming.

1094
01:01:42,434 --> 01:01:44,668
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

1095
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,570
You always know just
what to say, huh?

1096
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,706
I literally just said that.

1097
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,807
I hope you stay.

1098
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:52,543
Yo, is the reason why
you don't call me no more

1099
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:56,547
is cause you sell out or
cause you're just a star?

1100
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:58,216
What are you talking about?

1101
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,254
Eleven million views, man!

1102
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:02,520
What the fuck?

1103
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:04,390
You're like the Ariana
Grande of disloyal niggas.

1104
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:06,957
<i>Have a cola and smile, bitch!</i>

1105
01:02:10,698 --> 01:02:12,698
You could really
help us out right now.

1106
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,665
We got them by the balls,
but they're holding out.

1107
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,701
We got the info on how much
this is costing them.

1108
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:20,472
You flipping sides
could turn the tide.

1109
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:23,076
Don't be the leaf
that floats down the river.

1110
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:24,913
Be the stone that
splits the stream.

1111
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:27,480
Is that Tupac?

1112
01:02:35,556 --> 01:02:38,925
Welcome, friends! Gather around,

1113
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:40,729
Form a semi-circle.

1114
01:02:41,897 --> 01:02:46,933
Tonight, we will have a
transformative experience.

1115
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:48,535
In those containers,

1116
01:02:48,537 --> 01:02:50,836
there are broken cell phones,
used bullet casings,

1117
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:53,406
and water balloons filled
with sheep's blood.

1118
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:56,209
Cellphones can only work
with the mineral Coltan,

1119
01:02:56,211 --> 01:02:58,778
which is found
in Africa's Congo.

1120
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:03,249
The profit involved in this
has created hardship and wars.

1121
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:05,151
I will stand here.

1122
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:06,621
If you feel so moved,

1123
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:09,357
you may throw the items
in the containers at me.

1124
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,092
While I'm standing here,

1125
01:03:11,094 --> 01:03:12,594
I will be reciting excerpts

1126
01:03:12,596 --> 01:03:18,032
from the timeless
Motown-produced movie entitled

1127
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,500
"The Last Dragon".

1128
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:23,204
I'll recite those lines
Angela says to Eddie Arcadian

1129
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,443
as she leaves him.

1130
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:28,713
Let's begin.

1131
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:39,722
"And in the end, Eddie,
you know what?

1132
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:43,459
"You're nothing but a misguided
midget asshole

1133
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:45,794
"with dreams
of ruling the world.

1134
01:03:45,796 --> 01:03:49,164
"Yeah, and also
from Kew Gardens.

1135
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:53,369
And also getting by
on my tits."

1136
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,640
Bravo!

1137
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:01,677
"And in the end, Eddie,
you know what?

1138
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,583
"You're nothing but a
misguided midget asshole

1139
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:07,683
"with dreams
of ruling the world.

1140
01:04:07,685 --> 01:04:09,386
"And also from Kew Gardens.

1141
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:12,991
And also getting by
on my tits."

1142
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:22,367
"And in the end, Eddie,
you know what?

1143
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:25,035
"You're nothing but a mis...

1144
01:04:25,037 --> 01:04:28,740
"misguided midget asshole

1145
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:32,242
"with dreams
of ruling the world.

1146
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,312
"Yeah, also from Kew Gardens.

1147
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:37,582
And also getting by
on my tits."

1148
01:04:37,584 --> 01:04:40,017
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

1149
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:41,386
What the fuck is this?

1150
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:42,987
Why would you subject
yourself to this?

1151
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:45,424
It's a part of the show, Cassius.

1152
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:47,458
You of all people should
understand, right?

1153
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,661
- Stick to the script.
- No.

1154
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,397
Don't you have a party
to get to, Cash?

1155
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:53,700
Go!

1156
01:04:54,902 --> 01:04:56,704
Go, Cash.

1157
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:08,750
Let's begin again.

1158
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,054
"And in the end, Eddie..."

1159
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:34,741
Well, I guess
you're all wondering

1160
01:05:34,743 --> 01:05:36,112
why I've called this meeting!

1161
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:45,986
Hey. Hey.

1162
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,823
Fucking Sexy chocolate
motherfucker!

1163
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,225
- Oh yeah!
- Cool guy.

1164
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:53,461
You're coming with me.

1165
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:55,028
I know you're loving
the new digs.

1166
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,101
Or even better,
I'm digging the new love.

1167
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:00,668
Stick around because...

1168
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,836
I think a lot
of these bitches

1169
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:03,304
are gonna be
getting naked later.

1170
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:05,807
You know, I mean, your parties
are the stuff of folklore.

1171
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:07,842
You got to meet the man
of the hour though.

1172
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:10,411
Hey Cassius Green.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1173
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:12,414
An honor even, sir.

1174
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,481
It's okay, he's friendly.
He's friendly.

1175
01:06:14,483 --> 01:06:15,851
Oh, yeah, how you doing man?
You alright?

1176
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:17,219
I'm really well,
thank you.

1177
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:19,622
Thank you for inviting us, Mr. Lift.
It's amazing.

1178
01:06:19,624 --> 01:06:22,125
Just don't call me
"Mister."

1179
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:24,426
Oh, uh... Steve.

1180
01:06:24,428 --> 01:06:26,131
I never said "Steve."

1181
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,101
Sir.

1182
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:34,604
- I'm fucking kidding with you, man.
- Ow! Ow!

1183
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,305
You can call me
whatever you want,

1184
01:06:36,307 --> 01:06:37,839
you keep
closing those deals.

1185
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:40,810
You must be like a fucking genius.

1186
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,279
I'd love to pick your brain

1187
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,014
because we need people like
you over at WorryFree.

1188
01:06:44,016 --> 01:06:47,052
People who can comprehend
the big picture, you know?

1189
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:50,288
It's people like you that are
gonna save this nation.

1190
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,554
I mean look
don't get me wrong;

1191
01:06:51,556 --> 01:06:53,190
we still need the workers
to do the work.

1192
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:54,358
Per se.

1193
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,858
But we also need
people like you.

1194
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,362
People that can be trusted.

1195
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:01,764
People that can analyze
the challenge and adapt.

1196
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:04,036
Like a cunning racoon.

1197
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,738
Like a snake.

1198
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,809
Or like a tardigrade!

1199
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,713
Thanks...

1200
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:18,017
Go, I'll lock up.

1201
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:21,120
Great performance tonight, D!

1202
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:24,022
I told you,
you didn't have to do that.

1203
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:26,359
No, it's my pleasure.
It was good.

1204
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:33,934
So, you gonna tell me what
you thought about the show now?

1205
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,839
It was, uh...

1206
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,440
fiery.

1207
01:07:40,442 --> 01:07:42,674
Fiery? The fuck?

1208
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:44,310
That's what you thought?
That's it?

1209
01:07:44,312 --> 01:07:46,378
It was fiery.
It was great.

1210
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,984
Alright. Shh,
you can tell me later.

1211
01:07:54,555 --> 01:07:56,990
So now, I gotta climb over the
side of this overturned jeep

1212
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:58,492
cause I got to
pry the AK out

1213
01:07:58,494 --> 01:07:59,959
from under the crushed
bloody body

1214
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:02,629
of my now inconveniently
deceased guide, right?

1215
01:08:02,631 --> 01:08:04,263
And just as I get this thing out
I spin around.

1216
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:05,999
And this fucking thing
starts to charge and it...

1217
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:14,774
Fucker took two mags
to the head.

1218
01:08:14,776 --> 01:08:16,345
Turned that bitch
into a trophy.

1219
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:20,047
What about you, Cash?

1220
01:08:20,049 --> 01:08:22,382
You ever had to bust a cap
in anybody's ass?

1221
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:26,053
- Green, no...
- Shut the fuck up!

1222
01:08:26,055 --> 01:08:28,221
I'm talking to the man
of the hour here.

1223
01:08:28,223 --> 01:08:29,759
Come on man, have a seat.

1224
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,262
Come on.

1225
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,397
I want to hear about some of
that Oakland gangster shit, man.

1226
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,398
- Oaktown.
- Just right here?

1227
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,099
- Just sit down?
- Yeah.

1228
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:41,971
Well...

1229
01:08:41,973 --> 01:08:47,342
Luckily, I have not had
to put a cap in anyone's ass.

1230
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:48,910
Or head or anything.

1231
01:08:48,912 --> 01:08:52,681
So, I don't have any cool
stories, sorry.

1232
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:56,383
Alright, well I mean
give us something. Right?

1233
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:59,287
These boring cunts are at
every single one of my parties.

1234
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:01,989
You're different, man.
Make an impression.

1235
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:03,725
At least take off
the white voice.

1236
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,828
And I know you can
bust a rap, right?

1237
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,463
No, actually I can't.

1238
01:09:07,465 --> 01:09:09,066
Bullshit. Come on. Bullshit.

1239
01:09:09,068 --> 01:09:10,365
I can't, man.

1240
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:12,935
I mean I can listen to rap,
well, but I just can't rap.

1241
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:14,436
It's actually embarrassing.

1242
01:09:14,438 --> 01:09:15,739
I don't know.
I think he's lying.

1243
01:09:15,741 --> 01:09:16,939
I think you can rap.

1244
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:18,674
I think you should rap.

1245
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,275
Rap, rap, rap...

1246
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:23,747
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

1247
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:25,548
Rap, rap, rap.

1248
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:29,152
Rap, rap, rap,
rap, rap, rap.

1249
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:30,720
Rap, rap, rap.

1250
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:34,258
Rap, rap, rap,
rap, rap, rap.

1251
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:47,273
My name is Cash. I like to...

1252
01:09:49,309 --> 01:09:50,409
Smash!

1253
01:09:56,482 --> 01:09:59,352
I come from the land of dope.

1254
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:02,289
Somebody got something to smoke?

1255
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:10,627
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.

1256
01:10:10,629 --> 01:10:11,862
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1257
01:10:11,864 --> 01:10:13,130
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.

1258
01:10:13,132 --> 01:10:14,599
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1259
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:15,899
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.

1260
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:17,168
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1261
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,703
- Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
- Yeah!

1262
01:10:18,705 --> 01:10:20,206
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1263
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:22,240
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1264
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:24,743
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1265
01:10:24,745 --> 01:10:27,479
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1266
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:30,149
- Yeah!
- Nigger shit. Nigger shit. Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1267
01:10:30,151 --> 01:10:32,685
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1268
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,421
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1269
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:38,123
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1270
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,826
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1271
01:10:40,828 --> 01:10:42,398
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.

1272
01:10:45,768 --> 01:10:48,534
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1273
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,771
Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, shit.

1274
01:11:51,868 --> 01:11:53,735
Go through that big ass foyer.

1275
01:11:53,737 --> 01:11:55,337
Go through the door
next to the stairs.

1276
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:58,140
Go down the other stairs.
Hang a left.

1277
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:00,510
Go to the end of the hallway.

1278
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:01,912
Then make a right.

1279
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:04,046
You'll see it.

1280
01:12:04,048 --> 01:12:06,248
Big magenta color doors.
At the end of the halls.

1281
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,817
Steve Lift will be
waiting for you.

1282
01:12:07,819 --> 01:12:09,088
He wants you in there.

1283
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:14,924
Look here, young blood. We don't
cry about the shit that should be.

1284
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:17,427
We just thrive on what is
and what is...

1285
01:12:17,429 --> 01:12:18,932
opportunity.

1286
01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:22,168
This could be big, Cassius.

1287
01:12:23,535 --> 01:12:25,468
Don't do that thing.

1288
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:28,241
- What thing?
- That thing where you fuck it up.

1289
01:12:30,942 --> 01:12:32,411
Please, though.

1290
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:50,258
Heads up.

1291
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:54,328
This place is fucking nuts, man.

1292
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,297
Thank you. I will accept
your backhanded compliment.

1293
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:59,268
Please. Take a seat,
Mr. Cassius Green.

1294
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:06,240
- How's your head, you alright?
- No, it's perfect.

1295
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,842
Well, here, in this lair

1296
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,310
we do no line
before its time.

1297
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,447
And for you, my friend,
it is time.

1298
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:16,384
Cause you are rolling
with the big dogs now.

1299
01:14:16,386 --> 01:14:17,789
Fuck it!

1300
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:30,365
Fuck! It's strong, man!

1301
01:14:30,367 --> 01:14:33,636
Oh yeah. I have a
proposition for you, Cash.

1302
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:37,105
I will listen to your
proposition, Stevie.

1303
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:41,009
I want you at WorryFree.

1304
01:14:41,011 --> 01:14:42,980
I see something in you.

1305
01:14:42,982 --> 01:14:44,481
I think that you are more

1306
01:14:44,483 --> 01:14:46,215
than just the world's
greatest telemarketer

1307
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:47,817
since Hal Jameson.

1308
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:49,887
You know what
that's very interesting.

1309
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:50,920
Boring, though.

1310
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:52,821
I want to talk
about the dollars

1311
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:54,257
and zeros and the commas
and shit.

1312
01:14:54,259 --> 01:14:55,825
Cocky. I like it.

1313
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:57,694
Watch this little video
proposal we put together

1314
01:14:57,696 --> 01:14:59,428
and you'll understand
everything. Alright?

1315
01:15:05,238 --> 01:15:07,037
You know, I kind of
got to piss.

1316
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:08,438
So, could we, like,
kind of watch this

1317
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,907
after I get back
from the bathroom?

1318
01:15:09,909 --> 01:15:11,178
No.

1319
01:15:16,148 --> 01:15:17,982
Hell, I got to piss, man.

1320
01:15:17,984 --> 01:15:19,584
Okay fine.
Out the door,

1321
01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:21,685
halfway down the hallway,
jade door.

1322
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,090
Jade door, okay.

1323
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:37,804
Okay...

1324
01:15:40,507 --> 01:15:41,576
Wow...

1325
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:43,611
Alright...

1326
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:48,647
Shit...

1327
01:15:48,649 --> 01:15:49,851
One stall.

1328
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:54,087
Hey, you on your way
in or out, man?

1329
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:55,624
Can you help me?

1330
01:15:58,026 --> 01:16:00,726
No. No, I can't. Sorry.

1331
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,962
Please. Could you help me?

1332
01:16:02,964 --> 01:16:06,168
Fucked up, man.
I'm really hurt.

1333
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:12,508
Oh, shit. Okay.

1334
01:16:13,842 --> 01:16:15,376
Just hold on, man.

1335
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:25,119
Please... help me.

1336
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:28,155
Help me! Help me!

1337
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:35,762
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't touch me.

1338
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:38,167
- Help us!
- Help me!

1339
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,439
Hey, what the fuck!

1340
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:48,244
What the fuck, man!

1341
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,113
- I said the jade door.
- That is the jade door.

1342
01:16:52,115 --> 01:16:53,314
No, that's an olive door.

1343
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:54,816
That's very clearly
an olive door.

1344
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,084
That's a jade door.

1345
01:16:56,086 --> 01:16:57,619
Look, you got to get me
the fuck out of here.

1346
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:00,888
Okay, calm, calm. This is
a big misunderstanding. Okay?

1347
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,590
Let's just take a deep breath
and calm down.

1348
01:17:02,592 --> 01:17:03,924
We're gonna go
back to my office.

1349
01:17:03,926 --> 01:17:05,361
I'm gonna explain
everything to you, alright?

1350
01:17:05,363 --> 01:17:06,595
Wait, do you
still have to pee?

1351
01:17:06,597 --> 01:17:08,797
I mean, I pissed
on myself, man.

1352
01:17:08,799 --> 01:17:10,532
So, no I don't have to pee.

1353
01:17:10,534 --> 01:17:12,167
Look, I got to get
the fuck out of here.

1354
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,571
No, no, no, no, no, no...

1355
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,605
Here's the deal.

1356
01:17:17,607 --> 01:17:20,410
I can't let you leave without
explaining everything. Alright?

1357
01:17:20,412 --> 01:17:21,778
And if you'd even
seen the video

1358
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,712
before you went in there
you wouldn't even be scared.

1359
01:17:23,714 --> 01:17:26,484
What the fuck was that thing
in there, man?

1360
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:28,654
It's...

1361
01:17:32,057 --> 01:17:33,856
the video is gonna
show you everything.

1362
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,260
Don't worry about it.

1363
01:17:41,933 --> 01:17:44,669
There's a lot of
production value in this.

1364
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,881
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

1365
01:17:56,883 --> 01:18:00,084
<i>or least since before anyone
cares to remember</i>

1366
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:02,622
<i>we have used our wits
to survive.</i>

1367
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:07,091
<i>But what has
allowed us to thrive</i>

1368
01:18:07,093 --> 01:18:09,360
<i>was our use of tools.</i>

1369
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:11,698
<i>A natural development.</i>

1370
01:18:14,134 --> 01:18:16,299
<i>But what are tools</i>

1371
01:18:16,301 --> 01:18:18,303
<i>if not extensions
of the appendages</i>

1372
01:18:18,305 --> 01:18:19,707
<i>with which we were born?</i>

1373
01:18:21,108 --> 01:18:24,279
<i>Humans have modified ourselves
throughout history.</i>

1374
01:18:25,444 --> 01:18:28,245
<i>We train ourselves to fight.</i>

1375
01:18:28,247 --> 01:18:30,281
<i>We work out.</i>

1376
01:18:30,283 --> 01:18:31,782
<i>We study.</i>

1377
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:34,453
<i>Worryfree is carrying
forward this lineage</i>

1378
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:38,025
<i>of natural developments</i>
that began in prehistoric time.

1379
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:45,034
<i>We realize that human labor
has its limitations.</i>

1380
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:51,204
<i>And, so, our scientists
have discovered a way.</i>

1381
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:54,340
<i>A chemical change to make
humans stronger,</i>

1382
01:18:54,342 --> 01:18:56,410
<i>more obedient, more durable</i>

1383
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:59,713
<i>and therefore more
efficient and profitable.</i>

1384
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,515
<i>We are proud to announce
to our shareholders</i>

1385
01:19:02,517 --> 01:19:07,320
<i>that a new day in human
productivity is dawning.</i>

1386
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,355
<i>Our workforce
of Equisapiens</i>

1387
01:19:09,357 --> 01:19:10,757
<i>will make Worryfree</i>

1388
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:13,896
<i>the most profitable company
in human history.</i>

1389
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:16,764
<i>And you, our shareholders,</i>

1390
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:19,399
<i>will be a part
of that history.</i>

1391
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:22,403
See? It's all just a
big misunderstanding.

1392
01:19:22,405 --> 01:19:25,605
This ain't no fucking
misunderstanding, man!

1393
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:30,078
So, you making half-human,
half-horse fucking things

1394
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,446
so you can make more money?

1395
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:32,748
Yeah, basically.

1396
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,382
I just didn't want you
to think I was crazy.

1397
01:19:35,384 --> 01:19:36,985
That I was doing
this for no reason.

1398
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,320
Because this isn't irrational.

1399
01:19:39,322 --> 01:19:40,888
Oh.

1400
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,123
Cool. Alright.

1401
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,425
Cool. No, I understand.

1402
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:45,260
I just I just got
to leave now, man.

1403
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:47,261
So, please get the fuck
out of my way.

1404
01:19:47,263 --> 01:19:48,363
We haven't finished
the movie.

1405
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:49,698
Call me about that
next week, please.

1406
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,399
And then we'll talk about it.

1407
01:19:51,401 --> 01:19:53,503
Sit in that chair

1408
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:55,538
and we're gonna
watch this movie.

1409
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,609
And then I'm gonna
make you a proposal.

1410
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,978
Come on.

1411
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:08,249
<i>Our worker modification process</i>

1412
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:10,388
<i>is simple and rather quick.</i>

1413
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:18,262
<i>It works for
70% of humans</i>

1414
01:20:18,264 --> 01:20:20,533
<i>who take the
fusing catalyst.</i>

1415
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,281
And, see, this is how we begin

1416
01:20:37,283 --> 01:20:39,015
the process
of the transformation.

1417
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:40,684
They take what's called the fusing
catalyst. And what happens is...

1418
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:42,553
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, man.

1419
01:20:42,555 --> 01:20:45,489
What the fuck did you
give me to snort? Huh?

1420
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:47,358
What the... what the fuck
was that?

1421
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,658
- Wait, what?
- What did I snort?!

1422
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,928
Cause I'm, I'm not
even fucking high.

1423
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,929
You're not what?
Wait, wait wait. Wait.

1424
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:54,764
No, I don't give a fuck
about that anymore, alright?

1425
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,166
I don't give a fuck
about that shit.

1426
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:57,402
If you had me
snort some shit

1427
01:20:57,404 --> 01:20:58,569
that's gonna have
me mutated man

1428
01:20:58,571 --> 01:21:00,371
I want you to fucking shoot me!

1429
01:21:00,373 --> 01:21:03,640
Cash. What you snorted was
100% Peruvian, man.

1430
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:05,511
I need you to be a little bit
more particular, man.

1431
01:21:05,513 --> 01:21:08,413
You know, they got fucking
horses in Peru, probably.

1432
01:21:08,415 --> 01:21:11,382
- Motherfucker!
- You're gonna get semantic on me?

1433
01:21:11,384 --> 01:21:12,551
No, I'm not
getting semantic.

1434
01:21:12,553 --> 01:21:13,886
You're the one
that's being semantic

1435
01:21:13,888 --> 01:21:15,753
if you refer to the fucking
horses as a 100%.

1436
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:17,389
Fuck that.
It doesn't even matter.

1437
01:21:17,391 --> 01:21:18,657
Was it coke?
Was it not coke?

1438
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:21,527
- What was it?
- Cash. It was coke.

1439
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:23,596
Calm down, man.

1440
01:21:23,598 --> 01:21:25,430
You're... I wouldn't
just give you

1441
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:27,164
the fusing catalyst
without telling you.

1442
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,435
I'm not evil. Okay?

1443
01:21:29,437 --> 01:21:30,904
The reason you're not high

1444
01:21:30,906 --> 01:21:33,707
is because your adrenaline
is pumping so hard right now

1445
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:35,141
that to be perfectly honest

1446
01:21:35,143 --> 01:21:38,043
you're starting to harsh both
of our mellows. Okay?

1447
01:21:38,045 --> 01:21:41,114
So, sit down
and just take a breath, man.

1448
01:21:41,116 --> 01:21:42,216
It's fucking adrenaline.

1449
01:21:42,218 --> 01:21:44,116
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1450
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:46,285
It's fine, okay.
Just breathe.

1451
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:48,055
Okay?

1452
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:50,089
Fucking bitch...

1453
01:21:50,091 --> 01:21:51,857
Okay?

1454
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:56,099
Now, the proposal that
I want to make you is this...

1455
01:21:56,933 --> 01:21:59,799
That is the future
of labor. Okay?

1456
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:01,869
They're bigger.
They're stronger.

1457
01:22:01,871 --> 01:22:03,571
They hopefully
gripe a lot less.

1458
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:07,575
And also, soon, I'm gonna
have millions of them.

1459
01:22:07,577 --> 01:22:08,741
Fucking crazy...

1460
01:22:08,743 --> 01:22:10,443
They're gonna form
their own society.

1461
01:22:10,445 --> 01:22:12,379
They'll probably form
their own culture.

1462
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:14,115
Then maybe
they want to organize.

1463
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:15,516
Maybe they
want to rebel.

1464
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:18,786
And that's why we need
someone on the inside

1465
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:22,323
who represents
Worryfree's needs.

1466
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:24,595
Someone they can relate to.

1467
01:22:25,494 --> 01:22:27,594
To manage it.

1468
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:29,264
For fucking horse people.

1469
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:31,433
No. No.

1470
01:22:31,435 --> 01:22:36,504
The Equisapien
Martin Luther King, Junior.

1471
01:22:36,506 --> 01:22:39,073
But one that we create.

1472
01:22:39,075 --> 01:22:40,842
One that we control.

1473
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:43,979
So, you want to...
want to have a false leader

1474
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:46,015
for these fucking
horse people.

1475
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:48,518
But at the same time,
he works for you?

1476
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,989
Yeah. Keeps shit simple.

1477
01:22:53,691 --> 01:22:55,757
Well, why the fuck
did you choose me?

1478
01:22:55,759 --> 01:22:57,225
Out of everybody
you could have chose,

1479
01:22:57,227 --> 01:22:58,293
why did you pick me?

1480
01:22:58,295 --> 01:23:00,697
- For what?
- Cash. Cash.

1481
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:04,233
You are awesome.

1482
01:23:04,235 --> 01:23:06,802
I've never seen anyone
go through the ranks

1483
01:23:06,804 --> 01:23:08,838
at Regalview
like you did.

1484
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:12,275
And I want someone
like that at Worryfree.

1485
01:23:12,277 --> 01:23:13,709
Someone hungry.

1486
01:23:13,711 --> 01:23:15,779
Someone who'll fucking shank
their own friend in the back

1487
01:23:15,781 --> 01:23:18,114
if it means getting
what they want.

1488
01:23:18,116 --> 01:23:21,252
Now, look, I can see that
you're freaked out.

1489
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:23,319
And that you
want to say no.

1490
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:26,258
But I wouldn't do that before
you see what I'm offering.

1491
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:34,932
No, man. No, no.

1492
01:23:34,934 --> 01:23:36,468
There's no fucking
amount of money

1493
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,102
that will make me
do that shit.

1494
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:39,338
Two things.

1495
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,239
One:
it's a short-term contract.

1496
01:23:41,241 --> 01:23:43,074
Five years. Done.

1497
01:23:43,076 --> 01:23:45,110
Then we give you
the diffuser antidote

1498
01:23:45,112 --> 01:23:46,410
special sauce serum

1499
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:47,911
and you're back to normal.

1500
01:23:47,913 --> 01:23:51,383
And the second one, and I
want you to remember this.

1501
01:23:51,385 --> 01:23:53,888
You're gonna have
a horse cock.

1502
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:59,224
What the fuck is a special antidote
sauce serum. What the f...

1503
01:23:59,226 --> 01:24:00,793
It sounds like you
made that shit up, man.

1504
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:01,927
That shit ain't real.

1505
01:24:01,929 --> 01:24:04,729
No, it's real.
And so is my offer.

1506
01:24:04,731 --> 01:24:07,566
Five years as our man
amongst horses.

1507
01:24:07,568 --> 01:24:10,271
For one hundred
million dollars.

1508
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:13,438
Just go sleep on it. Okay?

1509
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,178
And after that,
holla at your boy. Okay.

1510
01:24:17,913 --> 01:24:21,083
Get out in that party
and go fuck something.

1511
01:24:50,045 --> 01:24:53,249
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1512
01:24:55,684 --> 01:24:58,388
Fuck! Fuck!

1513
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,070
Where's my cell phone?

1514
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:21,643
<i>San Francisco Chronicle, good morning.</i>

1515
01:25:21,645 --> 01:25:23,579
Um... Eric.
Eric Arnold, please.

1516
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:24,849
<i>One moment.</i>

1517
01:25:25,683 --> 01:25:27,281
<i>Hello.</i>

1518
01:25:27,283 --> 01:25:30,219
Okay, Eric Arnold.
My name is Cassius Green.

1519
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,722
I have some
important information.

1520
01:25:32,724 --> 01:25:34,191
Some very, very
important information

1521
01:25:34,193 --> 01:25:37,126
that I think you would really,
really be interested in.

1522
01:25:37,128 --> 01:25:41,130
- <i>Okay, shoot.</i>
- Okay, uh... alright.

1523
01:25:41,132 --> 01:25:44,200
They turning motherfuckers
into horse-people.

1524
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:47,637
Horse... half-horse, half-human
people that work. Alright.

1525
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:49,739
Look, they have you
snort some fucking coke,

1526
01:25:49,741 --> 01:25:51,208
and, well,
it's not really coke,

1527
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,243
but you snort it and it has
your nostrils get all big

1528
01:25:53,245 --> 01:25:54,944
and then you get
a horse dick and shit.

1529
01:25:54,946 --> 01:25:58,314
And listen... listen, you got
to get this story out here, man,

1530
01:25:58,316 --> 01:26:00,250
because look, you put...

1531
01:26:00,252 --> 01:26:01,218
<i>Jake?</i>

1532
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,255
What you talking about?
No. Cassius.

1533
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:06,090
Cassius Green.

1534
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:11,260
<i>The first thing we're gonna do</i>

1535
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:14,233
<i>is cut a little nib
into the cola can.</i>

1536
01:26:19,272 --> 01:26:23,877
<i>Voila! "Have a cola

<i>to happen in
advertising history</i>

1540
01:26:35,155 --> 01:26:37,322

1547
01:26:50,304 --> 01:26:51,904
- Cassius Green.
- <i>Cassius Green.</i>

1548
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,239
Alright Doc,
now I'm, uh...

1549
01:26:54,241 --> 01:26:55,842
I got a little worried,
you know.

1550
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:57,810
Because I was looking at it
maybe from up here.

1551
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,811
But that it might be different.

1552
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:01,249
Is it bigger?

1553
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:05,819
No. No, it's the same size.

1554
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,286
I mean, I'm glad
you're feeling yourself.

1555
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,522
Is that why you tried to
booty call me last night?

1556
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:13,058
I didn't try to booty call you.
I lost my phone. I told you.

1557
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,895
It doesn't matter.
I got a new one.

1558
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,362
What is up with you, Cash?

1559
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:18,831
You called me at 3:23.
You left a video message.

1560
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:19,999
I didn't check it,

1561
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,101
cause I assumed
it was lude as fuck

1562
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:22,303
and I wasn't
trying to do that...

1563
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:23,506
Can I see that?

1564
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,108
Come on.

1565
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:37,852

01:27:39,556 --> 01:27:41,888

01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,392

1569
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:46,662
<i>We're hurting!</i>

1570
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,598
Security code cleared.

1571
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,131

1574
01:27:56,973 --> 01:27:58,575
I found my phone.

1575
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,086
I don't know, Cash...

1576
01:28:11,088 --> 01:28:13,822
You got to do something.
People got to know.

1577
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,059
Right? Honey,
you got to tell them, right?

1578
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:17,362
Yeah. Yeah I mean...

1579
01:28:18,263 --> 01:28:20,029
- Why did you show...
- I don't know, alright.

1580
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:21,498
I snorted something that was...

1581
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,765
I thought it was activated

1582
01:28:22,767 --> 01:28:24,434
but it turned out
it was just coke...

1583
01:28:24,436 --> 01:28:26,468
But why did you focus
on your dick, though?

1584
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:27,637
They have big nostrils

1585
01:28:27,639 --> 01:28:29,338
you could have just asked me
to check your nostrils.

1586
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,343
- Okay check ‘em, check ‘em.
- Okay, okay.

1587
01:28:32,576 --> 01:28:33,877
Yeah, they look bigger.

1588
01:28:33,879 --> 01:28:35,444
- No, they don't.
- I think that's just cause...

1589
01:28:35,446 --> 01:28:37,346
- Yeah. You're flaring them.
- No, I'm not flaring them.

1590
01:28:37,348 --> 01:28:38,849
- You are, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1591
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:40,486
Just relax them a little bit
so I can see.

1592
01:28:41,754 --> 01:28:44,955
Okay. Look, listen. They're normal size.
They look normal size.

1593
01:28:44,957 --> 01:28:46,625
They look normal size.

1594
01:29:09,015 --> 01:29:10,115
I need you to know...

1595
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:12,517
I want to be clear...

1596
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,119
this can't happen again.

1597
01:29:14,121 --> 01:29:15,920
I'm not going back.

1598
01:29:15,922 --> 01:29:18,556
I'm not going to be
a fucking Power Caller.

1599
01:29:18,558 --> 01:29:20,424
That's a good decision.

1600
01:29:20,426 --> 01:29:21,625
But I...

1601
01:29:21,627 --> 01:29:23,495
- I still have problems with all this.
- I'm not...

1602
01:29:23,497 --> 01:29:25,763
Only something happening to you
turned you against them.

1603
01:29:25,765 --> 01:29:27,531
Okay. But I know
how they view me.

1604
01:29:27,533 --> 01:29:29,469
How I look in the eyes

1605
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:31,371
of fucking Worryfree
and Regalview.

1606
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:34,974
They just view me as another one
of their fucking creatures

1607
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,113
to control and to manipulate.
And that's not me.

1608
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,248
Good.

1609
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:43,719
Good.

1610
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:48,723
That doesn't change
what I said about us.

1611
01:29:51,059 --> 01:29:53,193
And also, I kind of
messed around

1612
01:29:53,195 --> 01:29:54,427
with somebody last night.

1613
01:29:54,429 --> 01:29:56,199
What? Wait...

1614
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:58,864
what do you mean you kind of...

1615
01:29:58,866 --> 01:30:00,567
I need you
to explain that one

1616
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:01,868
cause I don't understand

1617
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:05,574
what you mean by you kind of
messed around with somebody.

1618
01:30:06,508 --> 01:30:09,710
- I mean did you...
- Everything but.

1619
01:30:09,712 --> 01:30:10,844
Everything but.

1620
01:30:10,846 --> 01:30:12,045
You see, that's
almost worse than

1621
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:13,579
anything I can imagine
in my mind.

1622
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:18,022
- Everything but. So, did you...
- Cassius we were broken up.

1623
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,821
Okay? It's over.

1624
01:30:20,823 --> 01:30:23,559
It's me and you that shouldn't
have messed around tonight.

1625
01:30:33,836 --> 01:30:36,040
You want to know
who it was?

1626
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:39,540
Do you plan on fucking

1627
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:42,479
or "everything but"-ting
with that person again?

1628
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:44,716
No.

1629
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:49,621
Nah. No,
I don't want to know, then.

1630
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:54,259
No, I don't want to know.

1631
01:31:22,387 --> 01:31:24,823
I have absolutely no
idea what this is about.

1632
01:31:25,657 --> 01:31:28,158
Maybe it's saying that
capitalism dehumanizes them.

1633
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,528
Maybe the artist
is being literal.

1634
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:33,698
Maybe Worryfree is
turning workers into horses.

1635
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,635
And literally fucking them?

1636
01:31:47,946 --> 01:31:49,080
Hey, bro.

1637
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:50,413
Ain't you the dude
from the clip

1638
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:52,016
that got hit in the head
with the can?

1639
01:31:52,018 --> 01:31:54,386
No. No, everybody thinks
that's me, man.

1640
01:31:54,388 --> 01:31:56,488
- But that's not me.
- What's wrong with your head then?

1641
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:58,090
Man, everybody
thinks that's...

1642
01:31:58,092 --> 01:31:59,524
That's you,
that shit is funny!

1643
01:31:59,526 --> 01:32:02,796
- What the fuck, man?!
- For you lyin'!

1644
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:14,808
That's alright.

1645
01:32:16,077 --> 01:32:17,346
Happen to the best of us.

1646
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,318
Walk it off.

1647
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:33,692
This is Cassius Green

And-A-Smile-Bitch" fame.

1649
01:32:35,697 --> 01:32:37,499

1653
01:32:59,855 --> 01:33:02,121
You had
500 million people

1654
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,557
watch you get pegged
to the noggin

1655
01:33:03,559 --> 01:33:05,660
and get utterly humiliated.
It was effin hilarious.

1656
01:33:05,662 --> 01:33:07,495
The way your hair
went up like that...

1657
01:33:09,232 --> 01:33:11,131
The whole world is laughing
‘til they pissed.

1658
01:33:12,468 --> 01:33:15,403
Well, I got a new clip
that I need you to play

1659
01:33:15,405 --> 01:33:17,237
and the only reason
I came on the show

1660
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:19,140
was because you agreed
to show this clip

1661
01:33:19,142 --> 01:33:21,376
to your 150 million viewers.

1662
01:33:21,378 --> 01:33:23,277
Well, if you want some ass,
you have to bring some ass.

1663
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:24,946
So, we'll get ready
for an ass whipping,

1664
01:33:24,948 --> 01:33:26,279
then jump in the shit tank.

1665
01:33:26,281 --> 01:33:27,783
Then we'll play your clip.

1666
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:49,939
Could you play
my clip now, please?

1667
01:33:49,941 --> 01:33:51,273
Okay.

1668
01:33:51,275 --> 01:33:54,244
Is it as crazy as the
cola-and-a-smile-bitch clip?

1669
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:55,712
Not possible.

1670
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:59,181
It's crazy, Mary.

1671
01:33:59,183 --> 01:34:01,818
- It's fucking crazy.
- Woo-hoo.

1672
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:03,287

As a Power Caller

1678
01:34:17,571 --> 01:34:20,303
Worryfree was
my premier client.

1679
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:22,440
This is just
incontrovertible proof

1680
01:34:22,442 --> 01:34:24,575
of Worryfree's
evil practices.

1681
01:34:24,577 --> 01:34:27,611
They're turning humans into
grotesque horse-people.

<i>And I want the world to know</i>

1683

01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:33,883
No. No.
We're just doing dutch.

1706
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:40,357
- Thanks for calling, man.
- Yeah.

1707
01:35:41,191 --> 01:35:42,791
Look, I betrayed you.

1708
01:35:44,227 --> 01:35:46,092
I know it's not
gonna change anything,

1709
01:35:46,094 --> 01:35:47,595
but I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1710
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:52,002
- I acted stupid, I was...
- Man, hey, we... we good.

1711
01:35:52,803 --> 01:35:55,236
Alright, but all you
got to do is just...

1712
01:35:55,238 --> 01:35:56,771
just do right
from now on, man.

1713
01:35:56,773 --> 01:35:58,507
Yeah, I know
and that's what...

1714
01:35:58,509 --> 01:36:01,342
I tried to change it.
I tried to stop it. But it's...

1715
01:36:01,344 --> 01:36:02,709
it's just right in front
of their faces.

1716
01:36:02,711 --> 01:36:05,480
They're turning human beings
into monstrosities

1717
01:36:05,482 --> 01:36:06,714
and nobody
gives a fuck.

1718
01:36:06,716 --> 01:36:08,450
Most people that saw you
on that screen

1719
01:36:08,452 --> 01:36:10,985
knew calling their congressman
wasn't gonna do shit.

1720
01:36:10,987 --> 01:36:12,186
If you get shown a problem,

1721
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:13,655
but have no idea
how to control it,

1722
01:36:13,657 --> 01:36:15,924
then you just decide to get
used to the problem.

1723
01:36:15,926 --> 01:36:20,097
Yeah, and that's why our plan
for tomorrow...

1724
01:36:21,132 --> 01:36:23,098
is important.

1725
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,400
‘Cause if we stop them

1726
01:36:24,402 --> 01:36:27,468
from crossing the picket line
this time we win.

1727
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:30,339
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah.

1728
01:36:30,341 --> 01:36:32,844
Tomorrow we show ‘em
how to give fucks.

1729
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:38,813
Ain't that about a...

1730
01:36:38,815 --> 01:36:41,785
- Happy Halloween
- Look at that shit. You see that shit?

1731
01:36:41,787 --> 01:36:44,888
What the fuck is that about?
What the fuck, man.

1732
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,793
That's what
I'm talking about.

1733
01:36:50,995 --> 01:36:54,801
- <i>Get back in there!</i>
- <i>We're hurting! Help us!</i>

1734
01:37:01,539 --> 01:37:03,709
<i>Security code cleared.</i>

1735
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:11,783
Fuck you, Regalview!

1736
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:14,118
Fuck you, Regalview!
Fuck you, Regalview!

1737
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,654
None of the strikers here
at the Regalview strike

1738
01:37:16,656 --> 01:37:18,588
will tell us why
they're all wearing

1739
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,159
their Cola-And
A-Smile-Bitch wigs.

1740
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:23,761
Although the strikers
have been

1741
01:37:23,763 --> 01:37:25,930
extremely militant
over the past weeks,

1742
01:37:25,932 --> 01:37:29,133
they've not been able to stop
the Stackwater juggernaut

1743
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,802
from breaking through the lines.

1744
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:33,806
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1745
01:37:33,808 --> 01:37:36,874
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1746
01:37:36,876 --> 01:37:40,212
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1747
01:37:40,214 --> 01:37:42,213
Elbows and assholes, people!

1748
01:37:42,215 --> 01:37:43,484
Let's move!

1749
01:37:44,551 --> 01:37:47,351
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!...

1750
01:37:53,694 --> 01:37:56,629
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1751
01:37:56,631 --> 01:37:59,465
Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!

1752
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:01,099
Scabs won't pass!

1753
01:38:01,101 --> 01:38:04,170
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1754
01:38:09,077 --> 01:38:10,343
Oh!

1755
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,153
The infamous Cassius Green,

1756
01:38:20,155 --> 01:38:23,057
former Power Caller
and strike line crosser,

1757
01:38:23,059 --> 01:38:24,793
has switched sides.

1758
01:38:29,465 --> 01:38:31,735
- Yeah, man!
- Yeah!

1759
01:38:45,515 --> 01:38:48,149
Looks like the Calvary's
arrived, folks.

1760
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:09,072
Get the fuck back!

1761
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:10,675
This way! This way!

1762
01:39:12,943 --> 01:39:13,943
Come on!

1763
01:39:19,317 --> 01:39:20,350
Over here! Over here!

1764
01:39:24,354 --> 01:39:26,256
This is when
the magic happens.

1765
01:39:26,258 --> 01:39:28,094
Get them here quick.

1766
01:39:35,468 --> 01:39:36,970
Hey, Cassius.

1767
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:01,092
Look out! Look out!

1768
01:40:01,094 --> 01:40:02,995
Hey! Hey!

1769
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,836
Let me out!

1770
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:13,140
Hey!

1771
01:40:32,493 --> 01:40:34,294
Hold your ground!

1772
01:40:38,598 --> 01:40:41,236
Yes! Yes!

1773
01:41:18,974 --> 01:41:20,042
Wow!

1774
01:41:22,077 --> 01:41:23,177
Thank you.

1775
01:41:23,179 --> 01:41:25,480
We. Are Honored.

1776
01:41:25,482 --> 01:41:28,482
To. Be. In.
Your. Presence.

1777
01:41:28,484 --> 01:41:31,419
Dude. I'm from
East Oakland.

1778
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:32,853
Talk regular.

1779
01:41:32,855 --> 01:41:34,656
My name is DeMarius.

1780
01:41:34,658 --> 01:41:35,923
Thanks for
breaking us out.

1781
01:41:35,925 --> 01:41:39,996
Oh, I'm Cassius.
Cassius Green.

1782
01:41:40,831 --> 01:41:42,100
No problem.

1783
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,468
Worryfree is here.

1784
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:48,840
Hey. Same struggle.

1785
01:41:49,806 --> 01:41:51,074
Same fight.

1786
01:41:53,845 --> 01:41:56,381
Equisapiens!
Let's be out!

1787
01:42:02,988 --> 01:42:06,024
Equisapiens, thank you so much!

1788
01:42:09,927 --> 01:42:11,162
Hey!

1789
01:42:13,364 --> 01:42:15,200
Master mind.

1790
01:42:50,403 --> 01:42:51,903
Are you serious right now?

1791
01:42:51,905 --> 01:42:53,771
Serious as kicking the can.

1792
01:42:53,773 --> 01:42:55,172
Don't... don't play
with me, Cash

1793
01:42:55,174 --> 01:42:56,842
cause that's some
serious shit.

1794
01:42:56,844 --> 01:42:59,377
No, man. That's yours.

1795
01:42:59,379 --> 01:43:01,747
And I've got a car
that'll do me just fine

1796
01:43:01,749 --> 01:43:03,885
til I get back
to work at Regalview.

1797
01:43:06,888 --> 01:43:08,687
Plus, I wanted
to say I'm sorry.

1798
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:11,192
Cash, man. Look.

1799
01:43:11,925 --> 01:43:14,328
Just saying sorry is fine.

1800
01:43:16,596 --> 01:43:18,731
This is good.
This is perfect.

1801
01:43:18,733 --> 01:43:20,231
This is the
perfect apology.

1802
01:43:20,233 --> 01:43:23,138
I don't want disrespect you.
You know this is cool, I'm...

1803
01:43:26,407 --> 01:43:27,475
Hey!

1804
01:43:30,712 --> 01:43:32,148
So, uh...

1805
01:43:33,015 --> 01:43:34,214
now that we
won that strike

1806
01:43:34,216 --> 01:43:36,083
you cool coming
back to work with us

1807
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:39,452
lowly regular
telemarketers.

1808
01:43:39,454 --> 01:43:40,986
Well, if the new
and glorious

1809
01:43:40,988 --> 01:43:43,156
telemarketers union
will have me.

1810
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:45,193
You got to start fighting
somewhere.

1811
01:43:46,427 --> 01:43:48,295
- Huh?
- Alright, bro.

1812
01:43:48,297 --> 01:43:49,899
- Be good.
- Mm-hmm.

1813
01:43:50,765 --> 01:43:52,568
Kiss already, huh?

1814
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:04,080
So, what about being part
of something important, huh?

1815
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:06,179
Oh shit.

1816
01:44:06,181 --> 01:44:08,382
It looks like the sun
is about to explode.

1817
01:44:08,384 --> 01:44:09,416
Oh my god...

1818
01:44:09,418 --> 01:44:10,486
Come here, sugar.

1819
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:16,059
We are a part
of something important.

1820
01:44:16,826 --> 01:44:18,463
Changing the world.

1821
01:44:20,865 --> 01:44:22,599
Before the sun explodes.

1822
01:44:27,236 --> 01:44:28,337
Well...

1823
01:44:28,339 --> 01:44:30,738
I couldn't come back
to the exact same thing

1824
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:33,076
after all that, right?

1825
01:44:42,987 --> 01:44:44,419
What happened?

1826
01:44:47,325 --> 01:44:48,928
What, Cash?

1827
01:45:25,864 --> 01:45:26,965
What?

1828
01:45:27,801 --> 01:45:30,234
