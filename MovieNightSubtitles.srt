100
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,230
Last night I had a dream about you

101
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,120
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you

102
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,960
And it looked like everyone was having fun

103
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,930
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

104
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,630
Don't stop come a little closer

105
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,450
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger

106
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,400
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun

107
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,130
We were dancing all night long

108
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,060
The time is right to put my arms around you

109
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,560
You're feeling right

110
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,830
You wrap your arms around too

111
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,760
But suddenly I feel the shining sun

112
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,350
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

113
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,990

It might not be the right time

203
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,720
I might not be the right one

204
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:59,510
But there's something about us I want to say

205
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,350
Cause there's something between us anyway

206
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,020
I might not be the right one

207
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,810
It might not be the right time

208
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,570
But there's something about us I've got to do

209

Face to face now

220
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,900
Face to face

221
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,560
You are

222
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,230
Face to face now

223
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,540
With me

224
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,810
You are

225
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,460
Face to face now

226
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,940
Face to face

227
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,910
You are

228
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,690
Face to face now

229
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,770
With me

230
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,030
You are

231
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,760
Dancing

232
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,200
You are

233
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,770
Dancing

234
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,350
You are

235
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,980
Face to face now

236
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,550
Face to face

237
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,430

238
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,050
Face to face now

239
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,340
With me

240
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,660
What's going on

241
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,360
Could this be my understanding

242
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,770
It's not your fault

243
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,390
I was being too demanding

244
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,810
I must admit

245
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,540
It's my pride that made me distant

246
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,820
All because

247
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,420
I hoped that you'd be someone different

248
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,010
There's not much I know about you

249
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,570
Fear will always make you blind

250
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,380
But the answer is in clear view

251
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,990
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

252
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,240
You are

253
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,910
Face to face now

254
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:00,420
Face to face

255
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,280
You are

256
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,990
Face to face now

257
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,190
With me

258
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,570
You are

259
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,170
Face to face now

260
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,750
Face to face

261
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,450
You are

262
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,340
Face to face now

263
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,520
With me

264
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,800
I turned away

265
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,510
Because I thought you were the problem

266
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,790
Tried to forget

267
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,550
Until I hit the bottom

268
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,640
But when I faced you

269
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,470
In my blank confusion

270
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,470
I realized you weren't wrong,

271
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,730
It was a mere illusion

272
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,260
It really didn't make sense

273
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,650
Just to leave this unresolved

274
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,480
It's not hard to go the distance

275
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:58,160
When you finally get involved face to face

276
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,310
You are

277
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,130
Face to face now

278
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,640
Face to face

279
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,450
You are

280
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,970
Face to face now

281
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,320
With me

282
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,580
You are

283
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,400
Dancing

284
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,960
You are

285
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,450
Dancing

286
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,830
You are

287
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,430
Face to face now

288
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,160
Face to face

289
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,130
You are

290
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,820
Face to face now

291
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,150
With me

292
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,280
It really didn't make sense

293
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,940
Just to leave this unresolved

294
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,770
It's not hard to go the distance

295
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,380
When you finally get involved face to face

296
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,950
15 - TOO LONG

297
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,200
Too long...

298
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,910
Too long...

299
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,680

It's been much too long, I feel it coming on

302
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,660
The feelings getting strong

303
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,870
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on

304
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:40,540
The feelings in my bones

305
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,460
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on

306
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,660
The feelings getting strong

307
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,020
It's been much too long, I feel it coming on

308
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,690
The feelings in my bones

309
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:03,590
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

310
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:11,560
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

311
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,210
At last the long wait is over

312
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,130
the weight is off my shoulders

313
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,340
I'm taking all control, yeah

314
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,670
My mind is set so free

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,590
I'm where I want to be

316
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,730
To get the best of me

317
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:04,050
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

318
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:11,200
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

319
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,090
I see, you feel the way I do, the feeling so, so true

320
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:18,680

321

Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it
