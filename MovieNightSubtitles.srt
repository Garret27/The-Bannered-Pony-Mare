1
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:23,862
That's it. Gently.

2
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,784
We should head back inside, Tom.
Get you warm.

3
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,745
There's a big storm coming.

4
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:51,418
He looks kind of creepy, doesn't he?

5
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,521
I'll be right behind you, Tom.

6
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:21,204
E minor.

7
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:34,467
It's the right chord.

8
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:58,322
Hello.
- Ms. Whitman, it's Doctor Jansson.

9
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,865
I have some bad news.

10
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:12,249
What's wrong with you, princess?
Why won't you spin?

11
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,627
We had to bring your father in again.

12
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,708
As we predicted,
his episodes are becoming frequent.

13
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,463
This one looks quite serious.

14
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:31,595
Yeah... I understand.

15
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,317
Mr. Whitman
Tom.

16
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,824
You have to come a distance, but if
we could discuss this in person...

17
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:54,528
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.

18
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,459
Can you hear me, Mr. Whitman?

19
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,711
''Matthew knew it was hopeless.

20
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,841
Nothing mattered anymore.

21
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,629
Mr. White's body was melting
even as Matthew watched.

22
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:18,473
The snowman could no longer speak
The happy face Matthew had loved -

23
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,347
now was nothing but slush.

24
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,596
Matthew stared up into the sky, -

25
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,521
watching the winter's last snowflake
floating down.

26
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,901
Some said its touch held
the power of magic, -

27
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:34,612
but Matthew had lost his faith
in stories.

28
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:39,118
But when the snowflake finally touched
Mr. White's outstretched arm, -

29
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:42,487
a coating of fresh frost
spread outward from it, -

30
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:45,950
and the puddle of water
under the snowman crackled -

31
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:48,248
as it turned to ice.

32
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,295
Matthew's heart filled with joy
as he watched Mr. White come alive

33
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:57,000
The story of winter's last snowflake
had come true.

34
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:01,922
The magical winter would never end''

35
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,680
Time to go to bed, children.

36
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,728
You're that new boy, Tom.

37
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,517
You made that snowman in the backyard.

38
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,606
I'm Ann.

39
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,820
What's that?

40
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,732
She's beautiful.

41
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,491
Can't you talk?

42
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,735
I can talk.

43
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,912
Are those your parents?

44
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,080
That's my mom.
She got sick and

45
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,875
She's dead now.

46
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:42,672
My dad's a pilot.
- Is he dead too?

47
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:45,837
He's not dead!
My dad's Theodore Whitman.

48
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,719
And he's a hero.

49
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:51,174
He saved all his passengers
from a tornado.

50
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,883
But he crash-landed.

51
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:58,809
And when he gets rescued
he'll come and get me.

52
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:02,855
Nobody here has any parents.
- Lights out!

53
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:07,065
Good night, Tom.

54
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:18,704
Sleep tight, princess.

55
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,950
You'll melt for this.

56
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,502
Well, well, well...

57
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:03,079
Look who's here.

58
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,836
It's good to see an old friend.

59
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,964
I was just standing there
in the backyard, -

60
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,802
minding my own business,
and I felt this sting on my arm.

61
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:19,016
What?

62
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,892
I think it was that little thing.

63
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:26,318
Tom, let's you and me take a trip.
See where it goes next.

64
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:30,400
Who knows? Maybe we'll bump
into someone you used to know.

65
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:33,989
Encounter things
you've only dreamed of.

66
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,825
I... I'm dreaming.

67
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,445
That's why everything is so weird.

68
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,993
So come on. It'll be fun.

69
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,921
You'll be safe with me.

70
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:58,051
Listen, buddy, if you're too scared
to come along, I understand.

71
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,057
Maybe you're not a chip
off the old block.

72
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,510
Don't worry about it,
you can just go back to bed.

73
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:09,057
Or you can come with me
and have an adventure.

74
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,893
It feels so real!

75
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,194
Ice and genuine oak.

76
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,279
Hang on, buddy.
Let's go!

77
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,371
Now there's a sight for sore eyes

78
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,445
What's that?
- It's nothing, buddy.

79
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:10,368
Just a rotten pile of wood and steel.

80
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:13,452
Why don't we go take a look at it?

81
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:19,118
Look, it's your father.

82
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,176
Aren't you excited to see him?

83
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,338
It's just a dream.

84
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:36,757
This is as real as it gets for you,
buddy.

85
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,524
Ms. Whitman?

86
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,566
Your father has
multi-infarct dementia.

87
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,694
It's a condition caused by
multiple strokes.

88
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:00,818
We've spoken about this
several times over the phone.

89
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:04,163
Yes, we have.
But given his current condition...

90
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:07,084
- You want to pull the plug.

91
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:12,203
Well, it's not quite like that
He's not on life support

92
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,716
Though his heart did stop twice

93
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:20,178
We've brought him back, but to
keep doing it... -Where do I sign?

94
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,808
You're making the right decision.

95
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,272
It's best to let him go.

96
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:39,821
He's been living in a fantasy world
for the last couple of years.

97
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:44,117
He's regressed to childhood.
I just think it would be cruel to...

98
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:53,161
I can reach you at your father's
if we need to, uh, speak.

99
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:59,255
I don't expect you'd be flying back
in this weather.

100
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,831
No.

101
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,042
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

102
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:41,323
Nothing has changed, has it?

103
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,997
I'm not even a memory, am I?

104
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,006
I'm just a blur.
Like always.

105
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:58,515
You know,
I waited so long for you to reach out.

106
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:02,847
This was a mistake.
I've done enough for you.

107
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,211
Oh no!
We need to turn back!

108
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:35,296
It's too late! I can't!

109
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,712
No! Help!

110
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:45,848
No! Help!
- Hang on!

111
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:27,501
What?
What is this?

112
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,887
It's just you being you.

113
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:34,467
Hi, Tom.
It's been a while.

114
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,976
Do I know you?
- Of course

115
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,764
We've known each other since
we were kids. -You're crazy

116
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,107
I was.
For a while.

117
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:48,776
Come here.
Let me me patch you up.

118
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,777
You're wondering where you are...

119
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm in a dream.
With a crazy woman.

120
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,789
If I am,
it doesn't reflect well on you.

121
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,626
In all sorts of ways.

122
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:08,542
Actually,
I used to be your voice of reason.

123
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,419
God knows you needed one.

124
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,213
You were very good
at a lot of things.

125
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:18,004
But dealing with real world
wasn't one of them.

126
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,809
None of this makes any sense.

127
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:25,641
It should.

128
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:29,730
I'm just saying the things
you expect me to.

129
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:33,019
Buddy!
Hey! Where are you?

130
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,898
Hey! I'm here!
- Quiet.

131
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,990
He'll find you.

132
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,743
Oh! Leave it.
It'lljust remind you of him.

133
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,536
You're nuts.
Leave me alone!

134
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,003
Selfish and rude.
Yep, that's the Tom I know.

135
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,756
The Snowman isn't the best tour guide,
you know.

136
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,884
He's not what he seems.

137
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:05,800
Don't let him steal the rest of you.

138
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,721
I can 't see you, buddy!

139
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:13,055
I'm....
- Give me a yell, loud as you can!

140
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:17,267
Wretched brat, you're hiding!

141
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,893
Not so nice now, oh, is he?

142
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,519
Hey, you!

143
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,263
Be careful out here.
Those tracks are unstable.

144
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,728
A lot of them could collapse
on us at any time.

145
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,359
Why is this thing here?
- Beats me.

146
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,825
Somebody thought it was a great idea
to build it on this godforsaken place.

147
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,701
Hey! Wait!

148
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,033
Do you know where that music's
coming from? I've heard it before.

149
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,664
Kid, we've all heard it.

150
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,919
All day, every day.
Same damn melody.

151
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:31,710
Makes me sick.

152
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,505
Aaah! Come on!

153
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:41,129
Dammit!
Why do I even bother?

154
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:44,391
This thing can't be fixed!

155
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:50,806
What do you want to do, Gem?

156
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,353
Gem!

157
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:58,021
Just leave it.
It's lifeless.

158
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:01,778
Yes. Thank you
Let it rot.

159
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,031
You be careful.

160
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,644
Song of myself...

161
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,030
Worthless brat! I let him
out of my sight for a minute!

162
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,237
And all this bullshit shows up!

163
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:57,030
The little runt's more trouble
than he's worth.

164
00:18:57,206 --> 00:19:01,074
Ah, dammit!
Oh, woopsy! I missed a spot.

165
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,039
What are you doing?

166
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,547
Nothing.
I was just looking for you.

167
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:12,712
And now, I found you.

168
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:16,298
Come here!
Let me take a look at you!

169
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,179
What?
What, this?

170
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,141
Just took a bit of a beating
in the storm, is all.

171
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,268
Don't worry about me.

172
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,190
Hey! What do you say
we have some fun, huh?

173
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:34,441
No! What's wrong with you?
First, we fall, now this!

174
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:38,066
This dream's stupid.
I'm leaving. -Hey! Hold up, pal.

175
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,943
Relax.
I got something for just the two of us.

176
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,496
Two tickets to the circus.
It'll be great, buddy.

177
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:49,579
It's right around the corner.
Let me show you. -No.

178
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:52,375
Leave me alone!
You're making this too weird.

179
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:55,299
Don't you walk away from me!

180
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,264
Get out of there!

181
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,053
Come see what they've got!
- Go away!

182
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:10,726
It's okay, I'm not mad.

183
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:02,014
Come and share -

184
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:06,186
this painting with me.

185
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:08,654
No.

186
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:12,405
No! What happened?
What have you done?

187
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:18,032
Unveiling of me,
the magician that never failed.

188
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:28,661
This deep sigh
coiled around my chest

189
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:33,088
Hi, Tom.
I'm glad you got away.

190
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:39,345
What did you do with my Arabesque?
- You used to call it your princess.

191
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:44,227
Tell me.
Could she really spin like you said?

192
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:47,932
Or is that just another stupid lie?

193
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:52,733
Sorry.
Another story.

194
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,282
A silver platter!

195
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:02,197
Did you really think fixing it
would fix things with her?

196
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:06,662
No. You didn't really want
to fix things, did you?

197
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,584
I don't want that!
It's broken.

198
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,456
What are you doing?
It's mine!

199
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:15,747
I'll have what she's having.

200
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:24,174
Ice-cream castles,
lips-to-ear rhymes

201
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:31,180
A slumber deeper than time

202
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,940
Who are you?

203
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:39,725
Slow, love

204
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:44,606
Slow

205
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,199
Only the weak -

206
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:56,623
are not lonely

207
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,177
Slow

208
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:07,310
Slow, slow

209
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:33,498
Slow, love

210
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:37,498
Slow

211
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:44,836
Slow, slow

212
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:04,687
You used to play so beautifully, Tom.

213
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,491
You had a song for every
little thing in your life.

214
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:12,026
It's a shame it had to end.

215
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,735
I understand.

216
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:18,283
Would you quit calling me Tom?
You don't even know me!

217
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:21,375
It's you who no longer
knows people, Tom.

218
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:25,328
And it's your own fault.
For feeding him.

219
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:36,722
Don't let him take all of you!

220
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,434
Wait!

221
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,203
These doors of yours aren't going
to keep your secrets safe from me.

222
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:15,713
Dad.
I had a bad dream.

223
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,636
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

224
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:27,224
I'm doing nothing at all.

225
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:31,265
It's bedtime.
Go back to sleep.

226
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:34,855
But Dad...
- Is this about your mother again?

227
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,203
The circus...

228
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:53,658
It's not until tomorrow.

229
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,834
Just go to bed.

230
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:04,965
Dad...

231
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:09,091
What?

232
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:12,213
Are you scared?

233
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:16,437
How can you be scared of it
if you've never even seen it?

234
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:19,308
Huh?

235
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,934
Look.
It's just a bunch of clowns.

236
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:32,614
And trapeze artists
...wearing tights...

237
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:36,653
That's all.

238
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:40,081
Alright Buddy.

239
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,919
Back to bed now.

240
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:51,082
Thomas...
- Yes, sir.

241
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:00,723
Nothing.

242
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:04,937
Bed.Now.

243
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,286
No!

244
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,200
No!

245
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,369
... the snow storm is still escalating,
and the temperature is falling fast.

246
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:36,543
Our friends in the weather department
are forecasting record-breaking cold, -

247
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,630
so it's a good idea to stay indoors,
especially for the elderly.

248
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,468
The authorities are warning of
possible blackouts, so take extra care.

249
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,557
Maybe get yourself
some batteries and candles -

250
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,477
and keep an eye on for your elders.

251
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:56,981
Hello.

252
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:05,148
Well, well, look at you!

253
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:09,782
You're beautiful!
- Ann...

254
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:13,369
Of course.
How did you get in here?

255
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:17,157
It's a magic trick.
I can't reveal the secret, -

256
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,786
but it involved a brick.

257
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:23,454
Well, it's nice to see you.

258
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,843
What happened to
"you destroyed my life, you old bitch"?

259
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:31,924
Nobody destroyed my life.
You people just did what you wanted.

260
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:36,178
Everyone for themselves, right?
- That's unfair.

261
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:41,143
It wasn't like that.
- Really? What was it like?

262
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:44,481
Because the band, and the tours,
and the money -

263
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,478
and all that stupid crap...

264
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:49,191
That seemed more important
to my dad -

265
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:52,280
than anything that had to do
with me or my mom.

266
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:55,367
And even when he was home,
he was never here.

267
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:58,572
He was always lost
inside his own mind.

268
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,954
Anyway I don't care.

269
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:06,494
You may have unresolved issues
with Tom. I don't.

270
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:10,002
Oooh, yeah.
I can see that.

271
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,801
Well, it's not like I've ever
been a part of his life, so...

272
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:18,918
You were always the most
important part of his life.

273
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,010
There. That's better.

274
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:33,651
I don't know why he had to
put the bad ones up too.

275
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:38,104
He just could never let go.

276
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,737
How cute!

277
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,865
You used to be a happy kid.

278
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:54,577
I used to be.
All thanks to him.

279
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:01,049
All he ever wanted was...
was to forget everything.

280
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,921
And move on with you.

281
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:08,298
Of course, it didn't work out.

282
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,885
You know, Ann,
it was a long time ago...

283
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:17,137
You really should just let it go.

284
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:21,444
When you get old enough,
you don't fear death anymore.

285
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:25,061
You wait for it.
And after a while, you hope for it -

286
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:28,440
even if you don't admit it.
Do you know why?

287
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:33,859
Because losing your mind before
you go is worse than dying.

288
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:40,164
You hope you'll check out before
your brain turns to some mush.

289
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:44,833
Yeah, well,
you still seem pretty sharp.

290
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:48,126
I'm talking about your father.

291
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:53,003
He's in a dark place right now.

292
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,343
Doesn't it bother you
not knowing how he remembers you?

293
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:01,009
No.
I think it bothers you more.

294
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:04,722
If he remembers me at all,
it's as something that was broken -

295
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:07,223
and then put back together.

296
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,318
And he was never
really good at fixing things.

297
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:13,441
He did the best he could.

298
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,775
I'm tired.

299
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:26,330
You oughta be
more careful, buddy.

300
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,285
Or else you're going to turn this
into a nightmare -No!

301
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:33,796
You're hurting me!
- You know I would never do that!

302
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:37,417
I want what's best for you.

303
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:19,003
Oh, now this is the real deal.

304
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:22,549
Hey buddy!
What are you doing over there?

305
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:25,124
Come here. They're starting.

306
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:35,097
Sorry! Now I get it.
You're part of the act.

307
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:38,104
Oh, I gotta see this.

308
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:50,571
Once upon a time -

309
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:52,818
in a daymare

310
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:56,114
Dying to meet you, little child

311
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:58,363
Enter, enter this sideshow

312
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:04,287
Time for bed the cradle still rocks

313
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,663
13 chimes on a dead man's clock

314
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,248
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

315
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,505
Daddy!

316
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,266
The bride will lure you,
cook you, eat you

317
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,146
Your dear innocence boiled to
feed the evil in need of fear

318
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:38,741
Burning farms and squealing pigs

319
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:43,369
A pool of snakes to swim with,
oh sweet poison

320
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:46,408
Bite me, bite me

321
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:11,270
Ladies and gentlemen!

322
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:15,265
Be heartlessly welcome -

323
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:20,401
to Cirque De Morgue!

324
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:26,273
And what a show we have
for you tonight!

325
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,867
Madam.

326
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,291
Mr Thomas Whitman!

327
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,837
A composer and a poet!

328
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,590
A bad, bad father.

329
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:53,848
With a bad, bad memory!

330
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:10,903
No, please, stop!

331
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:15,359
No!

332
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,362
No!

333
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,625
Restless souls
will put on their dancing shoes

334
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:38,337
Mindless ghouls
with lot of limbs to lose.

335
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:43,840
Illusionists, contortionist,
Tightrope-walkers tightening the noose

336
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,188
Oh, look!
This one's about your wife.

337
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,441
Just about nothing left of her, I see.

338
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:02,115
Hardly.
Worth the effort.

339
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:28,054
Memories. It's not like
you have any real use for them.

340
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,020
We all lose parts of ourselves
bit by bit -

341
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,862
by bit

342
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:05,128
What?

343
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,423
What the hell?
That's not how it turns out!

344
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,520
Stop! That's all wrong!
Don't change it!

345
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,989
You're wrecking it!

346
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,044
Thomas.
- Yes, sir. -Nothing.

347
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,157
Goddammit!

348
00:43:41,593 --> 00:43:45,674
How many digits
do these things usually have?

349
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:48,131
I don't know.

350
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:51,808
Just don't try to break it.
It won't work.

351
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:56,307
We need to get this stupid thing open.

352
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:59,516
Why, Ann?

353
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:03,738
Cause when Tom locks
something away, it's important.

354
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,029
Well, he didn't have any money.
You guys pissed all of it away.

355
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,237
A little bitter, are we?

356
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:15,872
About having to pay for his care,
actually, yes, I am.

357
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,701
You did a good thing.

358
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:24,504
You let him stay here, at home,
with his memories.

359
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:27,840
Not so bad for somebody
who doesn't care about her father.

360
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:30,501
What were my options?

361
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,932
It was either that or have every
goddamn family friend drown me in guilt.

362
00:44:35,098 --> 00:44:37,306
Nonsense.

363
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:41,391
This family has been out of friends
for at least a decade, sweetheart.

364
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:46,391
I wonder why. What with Tom being
so famous for caring about people...

365
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,684
I keep telling you.

366
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:53,818
He cared.

367
00:45:08,544 --> 00:45:12,045
Another magic trick!

368
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:15,915
He picks something that he knew
he would never forget.

369
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,501
What a cliche!

370
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:24,305
What's in there?

371
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:43,363
"but all I am
is smoke and mirrors"

372
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:52,702
It's about him.

373
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,035
There's a shock!

374
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,522
"Miracles come in small packages"

375
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,850
"It takes so little to turn a child into
the most fortunate being in the world"

376
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:34,664
No! Stop!

377
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:42,094
Leave me alone!
I hate you!

378
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:44,671
Wait!
Who are you?

379
00:48:17,336 --> 00:48:19,412
Wait!

380
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:07,953
So. Satisfied now, are we?

381
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:12,210
Yes. Because this...
this is what I grew up with.

382
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:15,885
Scattered pages,
songs, words of wisdom.

383
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:19,221
Fairy tales all around me.

384
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,056
You see that thing?
His precious arabesque?

385
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:27,224
His princess. He said the dancer
inside would spin -

386
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:30,766
if I managed to play the chords right
when I was learning the piano.

387
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:32,734
Look, Gem...
- No!

388
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:36,353
His idea of raising me was to feed
me these endless pipe dreams -

389
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,440
and weird monologues.

390
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:40,692
Because everything
was a performance to him.

391
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:43,988
And he did the same thing
to my mom. Strung her along.

392
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:47,994
Kept making and breaking promises.
And she always believed him!

393
00:49:48,164 --> 00:49:51,084
Always!
And he always disappointed her!

394
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,921
Because you, you came first!

395
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:58,251
And then, she ended up dead
because of you.

396
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:04,006
I hope it was worth it.

397
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:09,095
Ouch! Shit!

398
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,348
Bonjour, mon general!

399
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:20,479
This. This is how small I was
in his magical, musical world.

400
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:25,191
D'you know he'd written songs
for everyone around him?

401
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,066
Maybe even for this little bastard here.

402
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:32,787
But never...
never for my mom or me.

403
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:08,813
Un, deux, trois, quatre!

404
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:14,408
Bonjour, mon general!
You were fortunate to find your way.

405
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:18,319
What's happening?
Where am I?

406
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:21,117
Why the battlefield, Sir.

407
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,659
You've fought in this room
for many years. Ha!

408
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,832
I'm ashamed that I wounded you
so grievously. And for nothing.

409
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:32,872
I don't know what you mean.
- Please, Sir, don't spare my feelings.

410
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:37,878
It was a mighty blow I struck.
I can only beg for your forgiveness.

411
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:43,217
I stepped on you.
- Tut-tut! I ambushed you.

412
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,263
But, Sir, my motives were pure.

413
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:51,478
It was a brave attempt to stop you
from going with the accursed snowman.

414
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:54,057
That evil pig!

415
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,860
It's the memories, Sir.

416
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:03,823
He takes them!
Takes you further in the darkness.

417
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,238
But why?
- You got old!

418
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:15,333
Still, you've got the best of him...
at least for now.

419
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,458
The best memories hurt him.

420
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:22,001
You've chased the very best one.

421
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:27,466
That girl...
- Yes! Your daughter!

422
00:52:28,806 --> 00:52:33,351
What a girl! What a memory!
Ah, c'est magnifique!

423
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,813
You remember best through the things
you both shared as children.

424
00:52:37,981 --> 00:52:42,394
Like myself or
the pretty mademoiselle -

425
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:44,977
within the glass bubble.

426
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:48,986
Hm, yes You loved us well
and so did your daughter.

427
00:52:49,991 --> 00:52:52,947
I don't remember her
- Ah, well...

428
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,987
There's nothing to be done then
C'est la vie!

429
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:59,739
This is as far as we go.

430
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:03,867
No. -Sir

431
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,167
I need your help.

432
00:53:10,384 --> 00:53:14,217
I need to remember her.

433
00:53:15,014 --> 00:53:17,553
I need to find her!

434
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:21,643
Comrades!

435
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:30,773
En avant! Marche!

436
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:44,245
You still have memories
that were precious to you.

437
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:48,283
You hid them. We know where
It's not too far.

438
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,497
I don't think I have many left.
- Oh, no.

439
00:53:51,671 --> 00:53:54,245
I don't even know
who am I anymore.

440
00:53:54,422 --> 00:53:56,417
We all take wounds, Sir.

441
00:53:56,592 --> 00:53:59,214
I'm sorry about that.
- Don't be, Sir.

442
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:02,222
I'm a mere soldier.
Just a casualty of war.

443
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:06,422
You could have disposed of us
Instead, you handed us on, -

444
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,851
and you told your daughter
how important we were.

445
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,141
Hourra! Hourra!

446
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,661
We have to hurry, Sir.

447
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:41,460
The night your mother
had the accident...

448
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:45,465
If Tom had gotten home earlier,
things might have been different.

449
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:48,803
He was with you, Ann!
- It's not what you think.

450
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:54,089
Back then,
my life was out of control.

451
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:57,435
Things were crazy,
with the band, with everything.

452
00:54:57,603 --> 00:55:00,391
It got too much for me.

453
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:04,481
I took some pills. But I didn't
take enough, because I woke up.

454
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:09,694
And then, when I did, Tom was there.
I didn't plan it that way.

455
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:14,067
I don't want to hear this.
- He stayed with me.

456
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,660
But he would not look at me,
not after what I had done.

457
00:55:18,831 --> 00:55:22,995
I bet that little stunt really screwed
with your precious band.

458
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:26,585
No, no.
Yeah, it was the end of the band.

459
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,626
True, but no, you see,
what I'd done was.

460
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:36,596
Ah, I don't know,
too personal for him.

461
00:55:39,682 --> 00:55:43,017
You don't know.
- Know what?

462
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:45,678
Oh, Gem, honey.

463
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:50,517
You don't know that
Tom's father killed himself?

464
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:54,821
Yeah Theodore Whitman shot
himself in the head.

465
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:58,778
And Tom watched it happen.

466
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:04,281
What I did was hard on him.

467
00:56:04,871 --> 00:56:09,284
And that night,
your mother had the accident.

468
00:56:11,085 --> 00:56:14,205
That's what broke up the band.

469
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:19,380
He didn't care but he knew
he was going to lose you as well.

470
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:24,177
Why are you telling me this?

471
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,846
Because I don't think
you know your father at all.

472
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:32,063
He worshipped Theodore
in spite of his dark moods.

473
00:56:33,104 --> 00:56:37,020
From what Tom told me,
he could be really mean.

474
00:56:37,608 --> 00:56:42,816
So, when Tom felt himself
going down the same path, -

475
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:46,402
he pushed you away.

476
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:52,818
I know.
He pushed very hard.

477
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,865
We have arrived, Sir.

478
00:57:54,343 --> 00:57:57,130
I remember...

479
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:08,682
Yes, I locked them away!
They're here!

480
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:14,642
May I say, Sir, it has been
a pleasure to serve you and yours.

481
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:47,800
"Miracles come in small packages.

482
00:58:47,972 --> 00:58:52,885
It takes so little to turn a child into
the most fortunate being in the world"

483
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:57,524
"It wasn't much of a circus.
It was cheap, shabby and rundown.

484
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:01,566
And she was enchanted
by everything she saw, -

485
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:03,977
laughing and squeezing my hand.

486
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:08,366
The first time I felt like a father,
watching her smile"

487
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:14,830
Why couldn't he just told me this?

488
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:19,126
He did tell you, in his way,
the only way he knew.

489
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:24,916
Oh man, I was always hoping
there might be something -

490
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:28,423
that would make it all worthwhile.

491
00:59:28,592 --> 00:59:32,128
Not this nonsense.
- Oh my God!

492
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:36,766
These aren't just scattered
thoughts or feelings. Look!

493
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:45,513
Mon dieu! A l'attaque!

494
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:05,491
Some of this is complete,
but the rest...

495
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:09,875
His words stop or just trail off.

496
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,250
Gaps, spaces...

497
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:32,806
"She's a true reflection of her mother,
my broken missing love.

498
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:37,566
So small but as wise
and as beautiful as she was.

499
01:00:40,197 --> 01:00:43,816
I am proud with love.

500
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:46,697
Now I push her away"

501
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:50,405
"She must not share my darkness.

502
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,709
I hope she'll understand one day"

503
01:00:55,835 --> 01:01:00,296
So this is where you stashed
all the good stuff, huh?

504
01:01:01,882 --> 01:01:06,462
What? This? I just took
a bit of a beating, is all.

505
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,639
You should see your little friends.

506
01:01:09,806 --> 01:01:12,379
I know what you've been up to.
Congratulations.

507
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,219
What did we learn, huh?

508
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:17,146
Your daddy had his fill of you,
took his own life.

509
01:01:17,312 --> 01:01:19,139
The songbird tried the same trick.

510
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:21,308
Then there's your little girl...
She hates you.

511
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,275
Nothing left if you ask me...

512
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:25,769
It seems like
you don't have much left either.

513
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,737
I've got one thing:

514
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:30,073
Magic.

515
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:34,453
Light brings darkness.
What sweet irony.

516
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:39,830
It's your world, your rules.

517
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:44,409
Now I wonder who dreamed that up.

518
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:50,255
And here it comes.

519
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:54,091
It's like watching
your greatest fear come alive.

520
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:35,255
A crow flew to me,
kept its distance

521
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:40,003
Such a proud creation

522
01:02:40,595 --> 01:02:45,257
I saw its soul,
envied its pride

523
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:49,679
But needed nothing it had.

524
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:55,476
An owl came to me, old and wise

525
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:59,317
Pierced right through my youth

526
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:05,570
I learned its ways,
envied its sense

527
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,118
But needed nothing it had.

528
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:15,578
A dove came to me,
had no fear

529
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:20,045
It rested on my arm

530
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:25,713
I touched its calm,
envied its love

531
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:30,968
But needed nothing it had.

532
01:03:31,722 --> 01:03:36,597
A swan of white,
she came to me

533
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:41,810
The lake mirrored
her beauty sweet

534
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:46,774
I kissed her neck,
adored her grace

535
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:52,235
But needed nothing she could give.

536
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,530
Ann. Ann!

537
01:03:58,913 --> 01:04:01,286
Look!

538
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:12,632
That's your dad for you.

539
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:18,008
Yeah, but just look at it.
I mean, he did all this by hand.

540
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:21,382
There are spaces,
things he didn't finish.

541
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:25,136
He started writing things down -

542
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:29,227
when he realized
that he was losing his mind.

543
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:34,311
So where is the last page?

544
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:45,115
What was it?

545
01:04:52,585 --> 01:04:56,452
All these fragments, memories...

546
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:58,796
It's his life.

547
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:02,881
Oh great.
- Hold on, I'll check if it's a fuse.

548
01:05:14,437 --> 01:05:18,353
Yep, it's the power:
Of course, the phone's dead.

549
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,737
I'm going over there.

550
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,405
Oh! Goddammit.
I can't call a cab.

551
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:39,115
Hey, I got a car.
- Really? Let's go.

552
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:57,345
Sorry, old man.

553
01:05:57,517 --> 01:06:00,969
Your daughter's
not picking up her phone.

554
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:03,305
Must be the storm.

555
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:19,365
No!
Not yet! I'm not finished!

556
01:06:55,777 --> 01:06:58,862
It's nearly over now!

557
01:07:02,866 --> 01:07:05,902
What are you gonna do,
outmaneuver me?

558
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:08,237
You're on a track, you idiot!

559
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:12,458
I know what's down there,
and you're not going to like it!

560
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,605
I won't let you do this!

561
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:58,747
You won't get that lucky again!

562
01:08:33,696 --> 01:08:36,318
E minor!

563
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:40,025
I was right
She did spin!

564
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:59,225
You hurry right in, I'll park the car.

565
01:10:00,147 --> 01:10:03,516
Go! I'll be right with you!

566
01:10:27,212 --> 01:10:31,292
I've got you now.
I'm all the future you'll ever have.

567
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:33,174
Buddy!

568
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:36,677
No!
You won't take my life from me again!

569
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:40,512
But I am gonna make
what's left of it a living hell

570
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:43,055
But why?
- Like you don't know.

571
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:47,769
All your music, all your hopes,
they're just ruins and blank canvas now.

572
01:10:47,938 --> 01:10:51,308
I'm all that you can bring to mind
You tell me why!

573
01:10:51,483 --> 01:10:55,066
I can't help it!
- You always knew I was poison!

574
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:58,155
You could have chosen her
if you'd cut me down to size.

575
01:10:58,323 --> 01:11:01,942
But you built me stronger every year!
- I had to!

576
01:11:02,118 --> 01:11:05,203
I never wanted to lose
the memory of you!

577
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:08,787
I've wiped you clean of useless
dreams and memories, -

578
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:11,495
you weak little brat.
- Dad, please!

579
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:15,713
I'll drag you down with me!
You always knew I would:!

580
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,882
Dad! Stop!

581
01:11:28,557 --> 01:11:31,643
I have to let you go.

582
01:11:52,078 --> 01:11:54,155
Daddy.

583
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:56,789
Daddy.

584
01:12:41,163 --> 01:12:44,117
Thanks for the ride.

585
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,010
Sleep tight, Princess.

586
01:14:29,258 --> 01:14:31,751
I'm here.

587
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:37,339
I'm so sorry.

588
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,810
Daddy.

589
01:14:55,614 --> 01:14:58,533
Is this what you want?

590
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:11,118
What?

591
01:15:28,894 --> 01:15:31,896
Princess.

592
01:16:57,888 --> 01:17:01,673
I'll hope to hear the chords
played again one day.

593
01:17:05,061 --> 01:17:09,190
Without them I'm lost
in this nothingness.

594
01:17:11,401 --> 01:17:16,110
Wandering after far off music
through a desert of ashes.

595
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:24,368
If a tune had a colour it would be
a mixture of pink and red

596
01:17:27,165 --> 01:17:30,581
Constantly afraid of it fading away

597
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:34,880
Terrified of the silence that may come.

598
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:49,930
My final memories are pulling me
towards the end of a black alley

599
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:54,728
There 's a door in the darkness...

600
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,648
I struggle to find my way
through the door.

601
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:18,919
I can hear it clearly now.

602
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:23,001
The most beautiful melody
ever created by man.

603
01:18:30,553 --> 01:18:33,425
I enter the room...

604
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,012
And there forever remains -

605
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:46,602
that change from G to E minor.
