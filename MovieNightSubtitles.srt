1
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:56,083
Come on, come on.

2
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,625
There! Head for that lighthouse,
noble reindeer.

3
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,833
Evening, Sants!

4
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:27,542
Thanks, Bill!

5
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:29,875
Whoa!

6
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,667
We made it! The last town in England.

7
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,833
Nearly home.

8
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:52,292
Oh, no. I thought getting here
was the hard part,

9
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,125
{\an8}but it turns out we've got
a town full of problems,

10
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:59,417
and it's going to take a big man
with a big beard to solve them.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Hmm!

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:07,125
<i>Yes, that handsome fellow
in the red onesie is me, Santa Claus.</i>

13
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,792
<i>And tonight has been a blizzard of bother.</i>

14
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,167
<i>Down to one reindeer
and the worst storm in history.</i>

15
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>- But that wasn't going to stop me.</i>
- Hup!

16
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:20,958
<i>Christmas in Wellington-on-Sea
sure needed a giant sackful of fixing.</i>

17
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,583
Ooh!

18
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,292
<i>You're about to hear the tale</i>

19
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,458
<i>of one of the most challenging nights
of my long career.</i>

20
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,708
<i>Looking back,</i>

21
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,250
<i>I think it all started going wrong
with the school Christmas play,</i>

22
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,667
<i>December 22nd, 4:00 p.m.</i>

23
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:01,875
<i>Wrap up warm
and get ready for</i> That Christmas.

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,333
<i>And here are our unfortunate heroes.</i>

25
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,125
<i>There's the new kid in town, Danny.</i>

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,167
<i>Trying hard not to be seen.</i>

27
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:18,042
<i>Well, except by the love of his life,
Anxious Sam.</i>

28
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,375
Oh. Have you seen my sister?
She's supposed to play Joseph.

29
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,875
Uh... no.

30
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,958
<i>And finally, our local rebel, Bernadette.</i>

31
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,667
Okay, kids. Time to unleash
your brilliance on the world.

32
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>A free-spirited force of nature
and director of the show.</i>

33
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,208
Perfect. Gorgeous.

34
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,292
Three minutes to curtain.
Do not disappoint me.

35
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,250
Oh, Charlie. Where are you?

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,958
Don't worry, Sam, she'll show up.
We've got loads of time.

37
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,458
If she doesn't, you can do her part.
Here, start warming up.

38
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,333
Oh, no. No, no, no.

39
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,333
You wrote it. You know the lines
and you're identical twins.

40
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,458
So, from a DNA perspective,
you're basically interchangeable.

41
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:56,042
No. Wait, Bernadette. In fact,
Charlie and I are actually very different.

42
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,375
- Year Threes.
- Bernie, I...

43
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,042
Two minutes to curtain.

44
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,500
Yes, Ms. Trapper.

45
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,583
Psst. Psst!

46
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,792
Danny!

47
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,708
Where's Dad?

48
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,583
Hey, new boy.

49
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,417
What are you supposed to be?

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,875
Yeah, what are you?

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,625
I'm a chickpea.

52
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,833
Then why do you look like a big potato?

53
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,167
Uh, well...

54
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,625
Thirty seconds to go.

55
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,458
Okay. This is getting a bit serious now.

56
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:28,917
Has anyone seen Charlie?

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,917
Anyone?

58
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,417
Thanks for joining us, Charlie.
Show time.

59
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,125
Let's light this candle.

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,958
Charlie, where have you been?

61
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:49,000
I decided my character has a beard.

62
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,417
Is that dog's hair?

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,583
Might be.

64
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,625
Trust me, sis, it's gonna be a triumph.

65
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,375
Samantha. Bernadette.

66
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,500
You're on. God help us all.

67
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,833
Absolutely love school plays.

68
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,375
Said nobody, ever.

69
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,500
Start the Kissmass play!

70
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,250
Woohoo!

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,250
Children in costumes
they can barely see out of

72
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,417
and a steep drop,
what could possibly go wrong?

73
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,333
<i>- Jesus...</i>
- Oh, God.

74
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,917
<i>...was a cool dude.</i>

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,583
<i>A beard, long hair, into woodwork.</i>

76
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,167
<i>A hipster, basically.</i>

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,875
<i>He wouldn't have wanted us to do
the same boring Christmas story</i>

78
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,833
<i>year after year, right, parents?</i>

79
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,083
- Uh...
- Huh?

80
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,208
<i>Exactly.</i>

81
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,417
<i>He'd want a strictly vegetarian,
multi-cultural fun fest</i>

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,542
<i>with lots of pop songs
and stuff about climate change,</i>

83
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,292
<i>written by our resident genius, Sam.</i>

84
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,708
- Over to you.
- Uh, yes.

85
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:49,208
I thought it might be
a good idea to change things...

86
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,167
<i>- Oh, uh...</i> Great speech, Sam.
<i>- Right.</i>

87
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,333
<i>Strap in, shape up and gird those loins
for</i> The Three Wise Women!

88
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,708
Hit it, Mrs. Beccles.

89
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,208
Off we go, Sam. Yeah!

90
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:05,958
Harry.

91
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,458
Curtain up.

92
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,917
Oh!

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,167
After a very long journey on foot

94
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,792
because obviously
we don't approve of flying,

95
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,042
we've at last arrived in Bethlehem.

96
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:17,958
Finally.

97
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:22,333
We must find somewhere to stay
because my wife Mary is pregnant...

98
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,667
Oh no!

99
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,458
Oh...

100
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,083
...with a large watermelon.

101
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,042
Charlie!

102
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,458
Quality improv.

103
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,958
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Jesus
Happy birthday, Jesus ♪</i>

104
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,458

00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,292
There, follow that star!

106
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,292
Whoo! Whoa! Yeouch!

107
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,750
We used to be shepherds
but now we're organic vegetable farmers.

108
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,583
We've come to see Jesus

109
00:06:55,667 --> 00:07:00,167
with our flock of broccoli,
sweetcorn, aubergines...

110
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,083
- Hi, Mum.
- ...and a chickpea.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,542
<i>And a chickpea!</i>

112
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,125
Chickpea.

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,708
...who looks a bit like a potato.

119
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,417
Oops.

120
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,125
- Nice one, Teddy.
- Silence!

121
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,292
Change quietly then join your parents.

122
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,375
Yes, Ms. Trapper.

123
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,750
Tomorrow, sanity will return
and we will celebrate term's end

124
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,250
with quadruple algebra
and a lice inspection.

125
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,792
Huh.

126
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,083
Now, move!

127
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,417
Bye!

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,417
Well done, new kid. Nice potato.

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,333
Uh... I...

130
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,000
- Bye, Teddy.
- Oh, never mind.

131
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,083
Move up, move up.

132
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,292
- Hey guys, did you like the show?
- I absolutely loved it.

133
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,625
Sweet. All of it?

134
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,833
Well...

135
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,958
I wasn't completely sure
about <i>all</i> the story changes, Bernie.

136
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:10,958
Oh.

137
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,042
Yeah, and some of the dialogue
was a bit... modern.

138
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,875
That was the whole point.
What about the jokes?

139
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,958
I don't think Jesus and jokes
go together, dear.

140
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,250
So, let's get this clear.

141
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,000
You liked everything
except the story, dialogue and the jokes?

142
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,667
That only leaves the title.

143
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,250
Oh, yes. Hated the title.

144
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,542
Ugh.

145
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,583
Clearly the Christmas revolution
is going to have to wait, Evie.

146
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh. Steady on, Basil.

147
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,125
Come on, keep up, tortoises.

148
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,333
Charlie was so late.
I've never been more terrified.

149
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,667
Yes, you have.
You're frightened of everything.

150
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,583
Am not.

151
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,667
Climate change, bee extinction,
bees full stop. Thursdays.

152
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,583
Me doing something naughty
and getting caught.

153
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,559
Me doing something naughty
and not getting caught.

154
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,583
Clowns. Safety pins. Unsafe pins.

155
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,542
Did I miss anything?

156
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,292
Infinity. There's just so much of it.

157
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,167
I rest my case!

158
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,976
Watch out, there's a big...

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,333
Charlie!

160
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,625
<i>It's a very lovely town,
Wellington.</i>

161
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,125
<i>One of my favorites in all of England.</i>

162
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,667
<i>A seaside world of bicycles,
bumpy bridges, bad driving...</i>

163
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
Into the hairpin...

164
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,750
<i>...sparkly streets</i>

165
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,375
<i>and a boatload
of wonderful Christmas traditions</i>

166
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,542
{\an8}<i>organized by my old pal,</i>

167
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,750
<i>Lighthouse Bill.</i>

168
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,333
Looking good, chaps!

169
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,458
<i>Everyone very keen on Christmas...</i>

170
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,875
Evening, McNutts!

171
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,708
<i>...and I mean everyone.</i>

172
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,417
Ah, at last.

173
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,167
Okay, neighbors, abandon chariot.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm never setting foot
in this wretched sardine can again.

175
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,250
Shh, Harry.

176
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,542
Thanks, Driver McNutt.

177
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,708
My pleasure, kids.

178
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,208
Last school run tomorrow

179
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,917
then after my delightful
sister's wedding,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,167
the Barn Family Christmas bonanza begins.

181
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,000
Best Christmas ever!

182
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,167
- See you tomorrow! Bye!
- Same Christmas, always.

183
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,083
Hi, Mum.

184
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:05,792
Mum?

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,958
{\an8}<i>Hi Danny, fab chickpea acting!</i>

186
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,375
{\an8}<i>Sorry I had to leave.</i>

187
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,292
<i>How'd it go?</i>

188
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,958
Well, it would have been better
if Dad had turned up.

189
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,667
And if the most beautiful
and cleverest girl on Earth

190
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,583
hadn't totally ignored me.

191
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,875
It was a disaster.

192
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,542
<i>Ah, that's nice.</i>

193
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,167
<i>My shift ends at midnight.
Dinner's in the oven...</i>

194
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,708
<i>Overcooked brown slop. You're welcome!</i>

195
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,417
Thanks, Mum.

196
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,458
<i>Love you, little slug.</i>

197
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,583
<i>And one day she will too.</i>

198
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,607
Last one to the top is a rotten egg.

199
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,708
Charlie, be careful.

200
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,167
I'm not racing.

201
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,375
I just want to be in bed by nine.

202
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,625
You can't catch me! Boo!

203
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,458
I win again.

204
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,667
Is there nothing I'm not good at?

205
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,625
Yes.

206
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,708
Being good.

207
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,792
Don't you think you should tidy
those things up before Santa comes?

208
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,542
Oh, found it.

209
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,250
Wow.

210
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,208
- Those are new.
- Yep.

211
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,750
Just dropping a hint for Santa.

212
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,708
I like those shiny guitars too.

213
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,458
In fact, it's top of my wish list.

214
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,542
Those are not "shiny guitars".

215
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,375
They are Single Cone National Resonators.

216
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,917
And there you go.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,542
"Santa, gimme or else..."

218
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,750
Or else what?

219
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,208
Or else I'll catch him in a sack
and I'll shave off his beard.

220
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,083
You can't blackmail Santa, Charlie.

221
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,167
Oh, don't stress, Samski.

222
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,417
The fat present dispenser gets me.

223
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,208
Oh, look.

224
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,292
It really is snowing now.

225
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,333
Wow, so pretty.

226
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,667
Yeah. Pretty big fun in store.

227
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,333
With you, Charlie,
big fun always means big trouble.

228
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,292
- Oh, no.
- What?

229
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,500
Don't tell me
that was Buddy's hair in your beard?

230
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,542
Come on! You're all wet and cold.

231
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,458
Maybe.

232
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,708
Seriously. If you do
one more naughty thing,

233
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,000
Santa won't leave you any presents at all

234
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:07,458
and then it'll be
the worst Christmas ever.

235
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,208
<i>Right. So you get the picture.</i>

236
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:13,625
<i>Christmas was knocking
on Wellington's front door.</i>

237
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,583
{\an8}<i>And everything was about to get
a lot more complicated.</i>

238
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,708
Blimey.

239
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:23,458
<i>Snow can be a very mixed blessing.</i>

240
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,542
Wow.

241
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,208
Snow day?

242
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,833
School's closed!

243
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,875
- Yeah!
- Death to Trapper's terrible test! Ow!

244
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,083
- Nice.
- Ugh. Not happening.

245
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,042
Morning, darling.

246
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't say it.

247
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,208
Absolutely love snow day!

248
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,208
- And you said it.
- Snow day!

249
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,917
- Let the snowball fight-ageddon begin.
- Yay!

250
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,375
Holy-flipping-moly!

251
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,393
What am I gonna do?

252
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,875
Snow day!

253
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,500
{\an8}Snow day!

254
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,542
<i>- Oh, my gosh, did you...? Wow.</i>
- Ooh.

255
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,542
Late, late, late.
Good morning! I can't believe I'm so late!

256
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,167
Good luck at school today, Danno.
And don't you be late!

257
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,750
I won't.

258
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,458
Wow. Look at that.

259
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,542
That's some serious snow.

260
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>Thanks for the tea and toast, eh.</i>

261
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,375
You're welcome.
You were late last night. Hot date?

262
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,042
Yes, with a 78-year-old on a bed pan.

263
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,167
Speaking of hot dates,

264
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,292
<i>how's the Sam Romance Campaign going?</i>

265
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,458
There's no campaign, Mum.
It's been six months.

266
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:08,417
I'm still the invisible new boy.
Except to Terrifying Ms. Trapper I'm not.

267
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,167
Well, if love was easy

268
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,042
<i>your father wouldn't have run off
with his 25-year-old dental nurse.</i>

269
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,042
<i>Mum. Don't be like that
when he comes back, okay?</i>

270
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,542
<i>I just want a fun Christmas.
Like we used to have.</i>

271
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
I know, sweetheart. But you know what?

272
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,042
It's only a matter of time
before you sweep Sam off her feet

273
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,542
and blaze off into the sunset
on your monster truck.

274
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,792
Plenty of holes in that plan.

275
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:32,125
Not a big girl sweeper-upper
and total lack of truck.

276
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,833
<i>Well, insignificant details.</i>

277
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm shy, she's anxious. It's hopeless.

278
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,167
Whew.

279
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,833
Everyone, come on out!

280
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,042
Wait for me!

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,083
Coming!

282
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,042
Yeouch!

283
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,708
Look what an angel I am.

284
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,917
Wow. Snow day.

285
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,417
Not so fast, Williams.

286
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,500
Hello, Ms. Trapper.

287
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,417
Hello, Williams.

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,958
There's no one here.

289
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,292
Indeed.

290
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,667
I'd better go then.

291
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,083
- Unless you don't.
- Sorry?

292
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,208
I assume you're here
because your mother went to work early

293
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:41,792
and didn't receive the message.

294
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,208
So, you are free
to catch up on your studies.

295
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,167
Well... Maybe.

296
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,417
Let me remind you
of your current scholastic status.

297
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,333
Chemistry, 15th out of 16.

298
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,750
Maths, 16th out of 16.

299
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,083
Want me to continue?

300
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,208
Not really.

301
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,333
Very wise. Inside please, Master Williams.

302
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,458
I'm going to get you!

303
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,125
- This means war!
- Teddy, duck!

304
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,708
- Oof.
- Oh!

305
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,000
Right in the pie-hole.

306
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,625
Revenge!

307
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,125
Throw me, Bernie!

308
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,417
Are we at all worried about leaving
poor Bernie with all our little monsters

309
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,893
when we go to the wedding tomorrow?

310
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,583
A bit, but... No.

311
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,542
She's pretty much an adult now
and she can be very responsible.

312
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,208
Parent attack!

313
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,000
- Sometimes.
- Ha!

314
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,167
Mm. I have my doubts.

315
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,958
She will get distracted by Netflix

316
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,375
and let the little ones start fires...

317
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,417
- Indoors.
- Oh.

318
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:42,708
So, 2x squared minus 5y plus 7y is...

319
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,458
{\an8}...Henry VIII's fifth wife
who was executed because she...

320
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,833
...mixed acid with alkaline and then...

321
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,667
...defined space-time singularities
in her native Sanskrit.

322
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,167
Williams?

323
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,667
Williams!

324
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,042
Were you sleeping, Williams?

325
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,083
Uh, concentrating, Miss.

326
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,417
With your eyes closed?

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,375
Well, that's my most intense
kind of concentration.

328
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,917
Take ten minutes outside.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,875
Maybe the extreme cold
will cryogenically reanimate your brain.

330
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,250
Charlie, what are you doing?

331
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,792
Shh... Here she comes.
You're going to love this.

332
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,792
You stupid dog.
Just wait until I get you inside.

333
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,292
Now watch.

334
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,333
You're a stubborn old fusspot.
I don't know why I put up with you.

335
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,351
Where are my keys?

336
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,667
My feet are freezin'!

337
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,167
Ugh... Oh! No!

338
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,667
Well done. Buddy never gets a treat.

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,292
Wait for it.

340
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,625
Leave that alone, you wretched dog! Oh!

341
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,375
Help, I've been murdered!

342
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,208
Yes! Bullseye! Yes, yes!

343
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,125
Charlotte Beccles!

344
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,208
Hmm?

345
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,583
If you had been concentrating
on your physics lessons, Williams,

346
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,125
you would know
that if an object of greater mass

347
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,583
is placed upon one of less great mass,
you get mush.

348
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:54,083
You need to make the lower snowball
larger than the upper one.

349
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,708
Simple Newtonian mechanics.

350
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:57,875
It was bigger.

351
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,333
But then a bit fell off.

352
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,458
Nonsense.

353
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,583
Do I have to teach
you children everything?

354
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
Watch and learn.

355
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,583
And one.

356
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,917
Oof.

357
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,417
Two.

358
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Three.

359
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,208
Four.

360
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,542
Five. Six.

361
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,958
Seven.

362
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,375
And that is how you make a snowman.

363
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,500
Oh.

364
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,833
Were you paying attention, Williams?

365
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,042
Uhm, yes.

366
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,917
Then make him a wife.

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Uh...

368
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,417
Not bad.

369
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,833
Oh.

370
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,625
Oh, for goodness sake.
Now, time for physics.

371
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,708
Yes, Miss.

372
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,708
Or you could do more practical physics

373
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,458
and build this gentleman
and his slightly wonky wife

374
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,375
somewhere to live.

375
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,792
What do you think, Williams?

376
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:33,667
She just happened to be standing
under the wrong tree at the wrong time.

377
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,292
It was a tragic mistake.

378
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,000
Was it a mistake?

379
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,583
Well... quite a lucky tragic mistake.

380
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,000
Charlie.

381
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,292
Right. I think that's quite enough
snow day for you two.

382
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,708
Let's just have
an hour of reading, shall we?

383
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,375
Oh!

384
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,167
Oh!

385
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,250
I...

386
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:08,250
<i>♪ He's making a list
He's checking it twice ♪</i>

387
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:13,333
<i>♪ He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice ♪</i>

388
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,458
Very subtle, Mum.

389
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:18,667
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming ♪</i>

390
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:22,833
<i>♪ To town ♪</i>

391
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,125
She is so doomed.

392
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,583
Come on, Evie.

393
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,208
- Kids, mince pies on the table!
- Bernie, piggy-back.

394
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,750
Oh, mince pies!

395
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,250
Abandon ship!

396
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,208
If only we could run the world,

397
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,333
it would be so much more fun.
Don't you think, Evie?

398
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,458
- Yes! Much more fun!
- Wait for me guys, wait!

399
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,500
Yeouch! Come on!

400
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,875
<i>Voilà!</i> Simple Newton mechanics.

401
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,125
Well, yes, I-I think that's satisfactory.

402
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,167
You've turned out to be
not so much of a dullard as you seem.

403
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,708
And that is the bell.

404
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,125
Pack up and home, Williams.

405
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,500
Oh. Already. Okay.

406
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,708
That was the most fun
I've had at school ever!

407
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,250
Can I just ask?

408
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,583
Where did you get so good at snow?

409
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,708
No. You may not. Off you go.

410
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,042
<i>Ah, poor Danny.</i>

411
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,333
<i>It's hard making new friends
sometimes, isn't it?</i>

412
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,833
Wait for me, guys.

413
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:52,625
<i>I always think that Christmas is a bit
like an emotional magnifying glass.</i>

414
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,167
<i>If you feel loved and happy,
Christmas will make you feel</i>

415
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,625
<i>even happier and more loved.</i>

416
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,125
<i>But if you feel alone and unloved,
the magnifier gets to work</i>

417
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>and makes all those bad things
bigger and worse.</i>

418
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:16,875
<i>And the last thing anyone needs
is a blizzard making things even trickier.</i>

419
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,434
See, I told you the storm
would be over by the time we leave.

420
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,167
Look, it's clearing up.

421
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,083
Tragically.

422
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,708
Right, Bernadette, you're in charge.

423
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,583
Great. More whooping it up, people.

424
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,250
After you've done all the things
on the Christmas Eve to do list.

425
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,125
Okay.

426
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,167
So it's going to be exactly
the same as always?

427
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,250
Of course. All the traditions.

428
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,833
Turkey lunch, lovely old Christmas film,
lovely Christmas walk.

429
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,750
Absolutely love the tradition
of traditional traditions.

430
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,708
Everyone does.

431
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,750
But do they? Completely sure about that?

432
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,458
Well yes, I think we are.

433
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:00,167
When did you start wanting
to change Christmas, Bernie?

434
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,958
When I stopped being six, Mum.

435
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:05,833
Okay, well, be that as it may,
just get the jobs done. That's your job.

436
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,042
Get the job done, Bernie.

437
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,042
Then wonderful Christmas begins

438
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,208
the moment we're back.

439
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,292
Oh.

440
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,458
Oh, sorry. I thought...
I thought we were all going to whoop.

441
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,708
Oh, no. I never whoop.

442
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,667
Bye-bye.

443
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,750
Bye, kids!

444
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,000
- Bye, Dad!
- Have a nice night!

445
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,875
Well, at least we have
eight parent-free hours.

446
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,500
Yes! Eight kid-free hours!

447
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,333
Absolutely love kids.

448
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:34,167
But it's nice to get away
from them sometimes.

449
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,500
- Huh?
- Whoa.

450
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,458
Aww.

451
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,000
Nice try, Eve McQueen,
my little escape artist.

452
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,125
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

453
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,500
Bye again...

454
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,417
Okay, fellow inmates,

455
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,000
the prison sentence starts
with a long list.

456
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,917
Yeouch.

457
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,083
Absolutely love ferries.

458
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,917
It's like a boat
giving a car a piggy back.

459
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,125
You love paperclips.

460
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,292
Oh, yeah, I really love paperclips.

461
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,708
The Rolls Royce
of holding things together.

462
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,958
Is it just me or are those
very dark clouds on the horizon?

463
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,458
Hmm.

464
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,768
{\an8}In breaking news,

465
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:18,250
{\an8}if you thought the snow was over,
you were wrong.

466
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,208
<i>Here comes The Big Blizzard Two.</i>

467
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:22,917
<i>The sequel is heading south</i>

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,875
<i>and it's definitely getting worse!</i>

469
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,750
Oh yes, I suppose so. Okay, yes.

470
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,917
I know.

471
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,375
All right, well good luck.
And thank you, Angie.

472
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,625
Right, we have a major situation.

473
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,542
What? What is it?

474
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,792
The snow has cut off the town

475
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,684
and the butcher
didn't get his Christmas delivery,

476
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,708
and that means Farmer Yirrell
is the only one with fresh turkeys so...

477
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,792
No. Yirrell is the worst.
He's a truly terrible turkey torturer.

478
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,167
And he used to call me names at school.

479
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,875
Nevertheless, we can't
have Christmas without a turkey.

480
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,417
Why not? They deserve to live.

481
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,625
Because without turkeys,
it just wouldn't be Christmas.

482
00:25:56,708 --> 00:26:00,042
Can't we celebrate without a turkey?
We can make an aubergine or...

483
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,000
Charlie! Charlie, my lovely girl.

484
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,333
It's time to go.

485
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,833
Oh.

486
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,875
Come on. Get a wiggle on.

487
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,333
Oh, shame.

488
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,625
What?

489
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,917
Ho-ho! Well, well, well, here they come.

490
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,792
Here they darn well come.

491
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:23,000
Time to turn meat into money.

492
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,250
Easy now, there's turkeys for everyone.

493
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,958
Someone should do something
about this hellhole.

494
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,583
They really should.

495
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,125
Just as a matter of interest, Mr. Yirrell,
what are you charging?

496
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,500
Oh, you know me, Specky-Beccles.

497
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,250
Only double the normal price.

498
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,625
- Double?
- For the small ones, yeah.

499
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,000
Triple for the chunkadunks,

500
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,500
on account of the recent fluctuation
in market conditions.

501
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,601
Is that legal?

502
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,125
Thing is, we need the turkey.

503
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,042
Cash payments only. I will be donating...

504
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,208
...all of the profits to myself.

505
00:26:58,542 --> 00:26:59,417
Don't call me that.

506
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,542
Charlie.

507
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,833
Do you have enough change?

508
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,750
Come to mama.

509
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,958
Places, please.
No fighting, folks,

510
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,768
or I'll get out me cattle prod.

511
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,500
Yes!

512
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:19,667
- Oh, no.
- Oh, Charlie, what are you doing?

513
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,792
Let us view the merchandise, shall we?

514
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,167
- Mr. Yirrell, uh...
- Huh?

515
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:29,875
I don't want to delay you,
but are those t-turkeys free range?

516
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:34,375
Well, yes, they're free to range
all around their... cage. Yeah.

517
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,000
- And, um... corn fed?
- Eh?

518
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:41,625
Well, no, not all corn fed more... mud fed.

519
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,167
Move. Move you daft blobs. Move.

520
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,833
Right, no more questions
from the irritating child.

521
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,375
Behind this door are proper birds...

522
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:54,542
Come on. Come on. Come on.

523
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:56,958
No!

524
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,082
Back off. Back off. Back off.

525
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:04,792
Ladies and gentlemen, juicy and jolly,
Yirrell's finest.

526
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,542
It's turkey time!

527
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,000
Eh? Whoa!

528
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,625
Ooh, grab one!

529
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,167
Gotcha! Oof!

530
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:23,917
Why do bad things always happen
to good people?

531
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,667
Charlie, you've ruined
Christmas lunch for everyone.

532
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,583
Except the turkeys.
I imagine this rather made their day.

533
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,625
Well, yes, nice for the turkeys,

534
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,917
but Santa's now definitely
not coming to you.

535
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,958
And can't you see
that spoils everything for me as well

536
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:42,042
because... because it spoils it for you.

537
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:47,708
And there we go.

538
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,708
A Christmas custard
for when Dad gets here.

539
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,458
Wow. White slop.

540
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:54,542
Exactly. With extra slop on top.

541
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,292
Now look, love, I really have to run.

542
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,458
I know it's Christmas Eve but you and
your Dad will have so much fun together.

543
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:01,917
He'll be here in an hour.

544
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,417
I bet with more presents than Santa.
See ya.

545
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,458
Oh. Don't forget the shopping list.

546
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,750
Huh?

547
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,726
<i>You could get
a little gift for your dad</i>

548
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,333
<i>at the Beccles shop.</i>

549
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,542
<i>Where Sam Beccles lives...</i>

550
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,833
Huh.

551
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:21,083
{\an8}It's getting worse, careful down there.

552
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,208
Don't bother rolling it up,
just get it down.

553
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,375
Whoa!

554
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,667
So long, Singalong.

555
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,500
Happy Christmas. Uh...

556
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,250
No. Happy X-mas Eve, Sammo.

557
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,542
Merry Christmas, Sam.

558
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,167
Sam? Come on, love.

559
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,208
- Thank you.
- Oh. Hi, Danny.

560
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,250
Uh... Yes. Danny... That's right.

561
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:46,458
Hi, Sam. Fancy seeing you here.

562
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,208
I live here.

563
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:51,458
Uh... Yes. Right. Of course.

564
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,542
I knew that.

565
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,375
Um...

566
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,333
Just doing some last minute shopping.

567
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,125
Uh...

568
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,500
Or would be, if you weren't shutting.

569
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:02,667
Sorry.

570
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,708
- Nobody's out because of the...
- Blizzard?

571
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,625
I was going to say "rapidly evolving
climate change disaster."

572
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,542
Yes. Climat-astrophe.

573
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,250
Um...

574
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:18,792
It's just my dad's coming,
and I was going to buy his favorite thing.

575
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,708
Wine gums.

576
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,917
Oh. I like them too. I-In fact...

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,833
Here.

578
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:27,125
Oh, wow. Great. Thank you.

579
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,042
Orange. His favorite color.

580
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,125
Except green. And yellow...

581
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,417
It needs a bit of a clean. Sorry.

582
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,333
Wine gums are much better
without fluff, on the whole.

583
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:42,750
Yeah.
Flufflessness. Always good.

584
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,583
Would you like to come in
and warm up for a minute,

585
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,333
out of the climat-astrophe?

586
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,042
Oh, yes!

587
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,458
No. Best get home.

588
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:56,375
Oh.

589
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,875
Don't want to miss the big moment
when my dad arrives.

590
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,458
Oh, okay. Exciting.

591
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,458
Bye then, Danny.

592
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,583
Merry Christmas... I hope, for you.

593
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,000
Goodbye... Sam.

594
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,375
Why did I say no?

595
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:25,125
I am the feeblest human alive.

596
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,208
Everything okay in there?

597
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:32,625
Uh. Yes. All good. Thanks.

598
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, Charlie, please.

599
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,523
<i>♪ Boom-shaka-laka ♪</i>

600
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,851
Can't we go now?

601
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,250
One last boogie!

602
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,958
You're right.
We'd better get back to the kids.

603
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,208
We have to get to that ferry, now.

604
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,417
It should be here somewhere.

605
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,167
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!

606
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,167
Oh, yes.

607
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,625
Don't panic.

608
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:17,875
{\an8}My app thingy says
there's a bridge to Sherringham

609
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,184
{\an8}at the other end of the island.

610
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,328
{\an8}We'll take the scenic route.

611
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,917
{\an8}Absolutely love bridges.

612
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,917
They're like roads that hover.

613
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,625
Clever birdies.

614
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,042
And where do you think
you're going, Houdini?

615
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,875
Come on. Lots to do.
They'll be back soon.

616
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,728
Come on. You've got this.

617
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,167
If you feel yourself losing traction,
steer into the skid.

618
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,958
No, don't steer off the bridge,
we'll drown!

619
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,708
I can't look.

620
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,875
Come on, old girl. You can do it.

621
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,101
- Ooh!
- What did I tell you?

622
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,292
Plain sailing from here.

623
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,958
Watch out! Look!

624
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,625
Brace, brace, brace.

625
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,042
Stop, stop, stop.

626
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,708
Ooh!

627
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,667
Stop!

628
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,708
Okay.

629
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,125
Were those...

630
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,208
- ...turkeys?
- Turkeys?

631
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:34,167
Well, we appear to be facing
the wrong direction.

632
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,542
Nothing a three-point turn can't fix.

633
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,292
Careful, careful or you'll go over the...

634
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,833
...edge.

635
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,333
Quick. Reverse.

636
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,875
Oh, it's not working. Give it some welly.

637
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,458
I'm trying!

638
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,412
You can do it!

639
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,333
I've got it! Everyone lean back.

640
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:56,250
Oh, yes. Good idea, Harry.
Just a little bit more.

641
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,083
- Yes!
- Hurray!

642
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,809
No, Teddy. Not over there.

643
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,958
Phone!

644
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,875
Who is it? Is it Mum?

645
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:08,958
<i>Hi, Bernadette.</i>

646
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,417
Hi, guys. What's up?

647
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,042
<i>So, um, there's been a tiny hiccup,</i>

648
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:16,875
<i>and it looks like we may not
make it back tonight.</i>

649
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,458
You won't be home for Christmas?

650
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,125
What? They won't be home for Christmas?

651
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,083
<i>It's a possibility.</i>

652
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,250
Mum, what happened to your hair?

653
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,292
Uh, yes, it's nothing.

654
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,167
Uh, so, Bernadette,

655
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,583
you'll all have to stay together
in the barn, okay?

656
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,958
Right, but what about
our Christmas stockings?

657
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,458
<i>Save some phone power to call for help.</i>

658
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,000
<i>You'll have to improvise.</i>

659
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,583
<i>Lock all the doors and stay together.</i>

660
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,708
<i>Nobody goes outside
until we're back. Okay?</i>

661
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,625
Really?

662
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,542
- Teddy, lock the door.
- Yes, boss.

663
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,708
We'll be fine.
I think we'll be fine...

664
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,500
<i>Just remember to keep an eye on Evie,</i>

665
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:56,167
<i>and I'm sure we'll be back by morning.</i>

666
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,917
<i>Or not, if we don't call
the emergency services.</i>

667
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,833
Huh?

668
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,125
- But...?
- Wait, what?

669
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,458
- No parents?
- Seriously?

670
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,750
I'm very, very sad now.

671
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,500
All right, click and release.

672
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,250
Here, let me help.

673
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,792
No, now your arm is on my...

674
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,000
- Ow. No. Ooh.
- Uh...

675
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,375
Is everyone okay?

676
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:19,583
Okay?

677
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,458
Gentle, gentle. Aah!

678
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,375
Uh, I said "gentle," Harry.

679
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,333
Oh, it can't be that bad.

680
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,667
Oh, it's... it's... It's that bad.

681
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,958
Uh, maybe we could walk home?

682
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,792
Only if you want to lose your toes,

683
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,792
your fingers, and other soft bits
to certain frostbite.

684
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,375
No. We must stay in the van.

685
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:42,917
I can't believe we won't be there
for Santa and the stockings.

686
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
Oh, you shouldn't worry about that.

687
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:45,417
Shouldn't I?

688
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,167
No, you should worry about
freezing to death out here

689
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,458
and never seeing another Christmas
of any kind.

690
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:51,833
Righto.

691
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,125
That won't happen.
Beyoncé's engine will keep the heat on.

692
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,417
Ugh,

693
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,417
Oh no.

694
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,042
You secretly named
this ridiculous old van after Beyoncé?

695
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,417
No, no. I mean, not <i>that</i> Beyoncé.

696
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:07,833
Huh?

697
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,375
Right, God hates me.
And that's official.

698
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,167
Dad!

699
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,708
<i>Hi Danny, I'm so sorry,
all the roads are blocked.</i>

700
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,042
- Oh.
<i>- There's so much snow.</i>

701
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,167
Oh, the snow.

702
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,750
<i>Yeah, it's really bad out there.</i>

703
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,833
Right.

704
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,601
<i>I'll try to make it there
for the New Years.</i>

705
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,625
Yes.

706
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,958
<i>- You won't be too sad, will you?</i>
- No.

707
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,833
<i>We'll make up for it next year, okay?
It will be great.</i>

708
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,000
Next year.

709
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,458
<i>- I'm sure Santa will...</i>

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,833
Huh?

726
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,542
Huh?

727
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,708
Of course he will.

728
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,417
Hey, what does pink bird want
Father Christmas to bring?

729
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,167
Just Mummy and Daddy.

730
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,458
Oh...

731
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,708
I know, Evie. I know.

732
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,893
- Night, everyone.
- Night, night.

733
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,351
- Night.
- Night night.

734
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,375
Goodnight.

735
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,250
Whose foot is this, by the way?

736
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,653
Oh, uh, that's mine.

737
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,958
Well, please move it.

738
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,917
Not to there!

739
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,417
As predicted, the worst Christmas ever.

{\an8}Ugh, I told you to leave sooner.

743
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,042
I can't believe Dad.

744
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,375
I'm sure he tried.

745
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:49,583
At least we have each other.
We'll make a great day of it.

746
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:56,458
Will Santa even come at all
if you're sleeping in my bed?

747
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,042
Of course he will, darling.
Of course he will.

748
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,500
Do you know what?

749
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:08,875
If I'd been able to choose between
Father Christmas and my actual dad,

750
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,917
I'd probably have chosen Dad.

<i>Well, this is where</i> I <i>came in.</i>

756
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,458
Hup! Hup!

757
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:03,792
Fly on, Dasher, most noble of reindeer.

758
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,208
Uh, I don't know
if you've noticed,

759
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,333
but there's a tiny bit of a blizzard
going on here.

760
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,417
Nonsense! It's just a light breeze.

761
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

762
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,708
Hey! Can't we just turn back?
We've done all the good countries already.

763
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,958
No! We can't let
a teeny bit of blizzard ruin Christmas.

764
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,458
There! Head for that lighthouse!

765
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,875
Okay, I'm going!

766
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,833
Oh, we're going to die!

767
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,375
Whoa!

768
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,875
Whoa! Thanks, Bill!

769
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,750
- Evening, Sants!
- Whoa!

770
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,250
Uh...

771
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,833
Whoa! Elf on the shelf!

772
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,542
Whoa!

773
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:54,000
Whoa! Ah! Whoa!

774
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,417
Whoa! Ah!

775
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:09,042
Ha ha! We made it. Nearly home.

776
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,476
Oh, no.

777
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I thought getting here
was the hard part

778
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,583
{\an8}but it turns out
we've got a town full of problems.

779
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:16,958
You can say that again.

780
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,875
All my mates are down
with the red nose flu

781
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,958
and my sparkly hooves are in agony.

782
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,125
Problem number one...

783
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,458
...Danny Williams.

784
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,625
Here goes.

785
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,500
If you take a tumble,
I'm putting you in a home.

786
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,458
Have I ever taken a tumble?

787
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,125
<i>Um...</i>

788
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,500
<i>Let's skip past this part, shall we?</i>

789
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,000
Whoa!

790
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,417
Oh!

791
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,250
Ugh.

792
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,083
Hmm. "A bit sad and lonely."

793
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,583
"Makes tea and toastie
every morning for his Mum."

794
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,542
But now his dad hasn't turned up.

795
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,208
Terrible. Terrible.

796
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,167
Something extra special needed here.

797
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,000
Hmm.

798
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,667
Perfect.

799
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,750
Hey, sweet antlers.

800
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,125
Uh, what about you and me
go flying together?

801
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,333
I'll take that as a "no" then.

802
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,292
Problem number two.

803
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:47,250
Five kids all in one barn
and no parents. Oh!

804
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,750
Interesting challenge.

805
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,917
Sants, you won't get all those sacks
down the chimney in one go.

806
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,750
I've been doing this a long time,
my grumpy friend.

807
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,292
Hup!

808
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,583
Hup!

809
00:42:58,958 --> 00:42:59,792
Oh!

810
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,500
One word.

811
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:11,958
One word from you and
I will get myself a self-driving sleigh.

812
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,750
Hup!

813
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,375
Told you.

814
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,583
And that's two words.

815
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,458
Right. Stockings. Stockings?

816
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,417
Very imaginative. Hmm.

817
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,167
Super Santa creativity required here.

818
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,750
Yes. Very good.

819
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,000
Clever.

820
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,083
Perfect.

821
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:52,250
Over to you now, mighty Bernadette.

822
00:43:56,792 --> 00:44:00,208
Now, problem number three,
the hardest of the lot,

823
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:03,292
a pair of twins, one's been very good,
but the other is...

824
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,833
The evil twin.
There's always an evil twin.

825
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:09,333
No, not evil,
but she's definitely been very naughty.

826
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,333
What to do?

827
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,708
Ah, just flip a coin.

828
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,792
We've still got Finland, Sweden

829
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,601
and that other one
with all the lederhosen to do.

830
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:19,042
Don't rush me. This really matters.

831
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,000
Where would we be
if everyone was naughty all the time?

832
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,833
"Refused to tidy her room."

833
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:47,125
"Shaved a dog to make a beard"
and... good lord,

834
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,417
"Released
all of Farmer Yirrell's turkeys."

835
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,875
Oh, get on with it, boss.

836
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,792
My unmentionables
are turning into snowballs out here.

837
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:05,250
Alas, alas, but it must be done.

838
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:10,625
<i>For all the talk
of who's naughty and who's nice,</i>

839
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,458
<i>it's actually incredibly rare for me</i>

840
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:18,708
<i>to follow through with an empty stocking
on actual Christmas night.</i>

841
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,583
Oh, dear, that's a dreadful thing to do.

842
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,208
Right, where to next? Jamaica? Barbados?

843
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,708
No. Iceland.

844
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,458
Hip, hip.

845
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:34,875
Farewell, Wellington-on-Sea!

846
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,667
I knew it would be okay.

847
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,292
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

848
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,167
Charlie Beccles, rock star supreme.

849
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:03,833
Oh, no.

850
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,083
He got the wrong twin.

851
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,542
Ahh...

852
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,167
Oh, no, what does that mean?
Did you forget Finland again?

853
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:59,042
No, it's wonderful news.

854
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,250
Sorry pal, it's going to be a long night.

855
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,792
Long night?

856
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,542
It's already been one endless,

857
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,750
tear off your own antlers
and eat them long night.

858
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,833
Well, it's about to get longer.
And marvelous!

859
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,750
So where are we going, big man?

860
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,625
Back to Wellington-on-Sea.

861
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,792
The naughty twin
turns out not to be naughty after all.

862
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,792
Oh! This is my first
Code Red for fifty years!

863
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,708
Code Red? Nice.

864
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:27,375
Let's dust off one of these old beauties.

865
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,750
Right, time is tight.

866
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,333
Let's blow a hole in the sky, baby.

867
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,500
All righty then.

868
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,667
I've got a little bit more
left in the tank. Check this.

869
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,750
Whoa!

870
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,417
I love this job!

871
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:53,625
Oh, my goodness!

872
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,417
Charlie, Charlie! Look.

873
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,250
Santa came. Oh, gosh, look!

874
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,917
Yeah, you got the guitar!

875
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,833
But why aren't you opening yours?

876
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,375
Well, I wasn't so lucky.

877
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,708
What do you mean?

878
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:09,125
I guess I was too naughty after all.
I should have been less...

879
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,375
Charlie, it's bursting!

880
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,458
What?

881
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,417
Oh, no, Sam's having a panic attack.

882
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,417
Brace yourself.

883
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,750
She got a full stocking!

884
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,458
I got a full stocking.

885
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:30,875
Oh, my gosh. Sam!

886
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,583
I was ready to call an ambulance.

887
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,417
Look at this one!

888
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,875
What is happening? Chocolate!

889
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,792
Oh, yes.

890
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,375
This is amazing!

891
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,625
Oh!

892
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:45,042
No way. Drumsticks!

893
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,458
Oh, there's something left in Charlie's.

894
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:48,708
Is there?

895
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,917
I thought I felt something.

896
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,333
Um... uh...

897
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:53,667
I don't think so.

898
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,958
Mum, it's just what I've always wanted.

899
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:57,708
Oh, yes, isn't it?

900
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,708
<i>Officially nice.</i>

901
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,083
You did find something.

902
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,458
No. I-It was nothing.

903
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,542
Oh, okay.

904
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,542
Mum, listen to what I learnt at school.

905
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,958
- Thank you.
<i>- You're very welcome.</i>

906
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:12,958
Good old Santa.

907
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,625
Merry Christmas, little slug.

908
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,000
Yes!

909
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,292
<i>Look outside.</i>

910
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,917
Flipping heck.

911
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,458
Huh?

912
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:52,417
Mummy? Daddy?

913
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:56,167
Oh, no, they're not back.

914
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,500
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

915
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,417
Oof! Oh, gosh.

916
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,833
Christmas is ruined.

917
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:03,583
Or it's not.

918
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,417
Look in your stockings. Santa came.

919
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
- What?
- Really?

920
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:10,958
And he's left
some very interesting things.

921
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:14,833
A blaster gun? Weird.

922
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,833
A power washer? Double weird.

923
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,917
A karaoke machine?

924
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,042
Hmm...

925
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,125
Whippedy cream!

926
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,417
Bit weird.

927
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,667
What's that?

928
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,143
- I don't get it.
- Well, duh.

929
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:29,958
Everyone, it's Christmas morning
and our parents are nowhere to be seen,

930
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:34,250
which could be a problem, true,
but it seems to me

931
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:37,833
Santa's gifts are asking
a very intriguing question.

932
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:40,809
Do we always love everything
about the Christmas arrangements?

933
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,667
- Hmm...
- Um...

934
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,750
Christmas lunch with all the trimmings?

935
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,167
{\an8}<i>- Ugh.
- Sprouts.</i>

936
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,458
Nope.

937
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:48,708
Washing up after lunch?

938
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:49,917
{\an8}<i>Finished.</i>

939
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
{\an8}<i>Uh...</i>

940
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,292
Nuh-uh.

941
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,958
How about the big walk?

942
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,458
{\an8}<i>I don't seem
to be able to walk straight.</i>

943
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,333
- No!
- Yes!

944
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:02,542
I mean, no.

945
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,417
And then the lovely old Christmas film.

946
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,958
I hate the lovely old Christmas film.

947
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:15,542
Exactly as I thought.
Do we think we could do a lot better?

948
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,875
- Definitely.
- Um, yes.

949
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:20,667
Right, so, big moment, kids. Big moment.

950
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,625
One of those moments
that defines who we are.

951
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,542
Do we have a vision for the future

952
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,375
that is better and brighter
and always more fun?

953
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,792
Yes!

954
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:34,750
Children of Wellington-on-Sea, get ready.

955
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:35,833
It's time

956
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:39,417
for our Christmas!

957
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,750
Yes!

958
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,667
<i>This is why I love my job.
Quite proud of that one.</i>

959
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,292
Whoa!

960
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,333
Mum! Mum.

961
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,833
Mum?

962
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,167
Oh, come on, Jan.

963
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,917
Danny's dad has just let him down

964
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,708
and I can't miss Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day.

965
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:00,333
Yes, I kn...

966
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,000
I know she's very sick.

967
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,292
Okay... Okay.

968
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,375
Okay.

969
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:10,875
I'll do it.

970
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,917
Damn it.

971
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,500
Not today too.

972
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,393
Nobody else can get through

973
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,208
and I'm the only one
in trudging distance of the hospital.

974
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:20,750
There must be someone.

975
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,083
Someone who didn't just get divorced.

976
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:27,167
Look, do you know Bill,
the lighthouse keeper?

977
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,250
Uh-uh.

978
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:30,750
Well, his Mum might be dying.

979
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,625
And that's not fun.

980
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,875
She likes me
and she doesn't like many people.

981
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,875
It's not nice to die with someone
you don't like holding your hand.

982
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,583
Okay, I get it.

983
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,750
Mrs. Lighthouse and her not nice death

984
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,958
is more important
than you and me and Christmas.

985
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,083
Oh, love, of course it isn't.

986
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,792
But it's my job.

987
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:53,851
Look, I'll ring around, I'll find someone
to look after you until I get back.

988
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:58,792
Don't bother.
I'm fine on my own. I'm used to it.

989
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,750
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

990
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:04,208
Just you and me is just fine.

991
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,875
We'll have a really special dinner
when I get home. Okay?

992
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:10,708
What? Extra big portion of red slop?

993
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:14,333
I'd better go and get ready.

994
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,750
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

995
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,833
<i>The problem is,
no matter how well I do my job,</i>

996
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:24,042
<i>life is complicated.</i>

997
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:27,750
<i>And when my big night is over,
it all starts up again.</i>

998
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,208
<i>And it's up to you lot
to sort things out yourselves.</i>

999
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:37,167
You're doing great, honey!

1000
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,917
Keep up, Harry! You can do it too!

1001
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,083
I am keeping up, darling.

1002
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,333
Ooh! Oh...

1003
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,583
Nearly there!

1004
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:47,375
Uh...

1005
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,500
- No, no.
- Shoes off.

1006
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,083
Please! Ow!

1007
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,000
Watch out!

1008
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:54,042
- I'm on you! I'm riding...
- Stop, stop.

1009
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,958
Who could have predicted this calamity?

1010
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,500
Oh, that's right, me.

1011
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,875
Oh, no. The poor kids.

1012
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,792
Oh, how will they cope without us?

1013
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,167
Are you ready?

1014
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,125
Yes.

1015
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:23,833
Children of the barn,
Christmas lunch our way!

1016
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:25,000
Pizza!

1017
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:31,042
<i>♪ Snow is falling

1018
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,292

1020
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:36,750
Do it.

1021
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,417
Whippedy cream!

1022
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,250
For you. Finished!

1023
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,917
Christmas, 27% better.

1024
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,875
- Let's go!
- Awesome!

1025
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,292
Scarlett, time for your gift.

1026
00:54:58,667 --> 00:54:59,667
Wow...

1027
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,042
Eat sprouts, suckers!

1028
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,750
Yay!

1029
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,750
Take that! And that.

1030
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:10,833
And bam!

1031
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:14,833
- Christmas, 48% better.
- Mm-hmm.

1032
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,125
Now, washing up.

1033
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,542
Over to you, Tedwardo.

1034
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:25,667
Behold the magic of the power washer!

1035
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,125
Now, Evie!

1036
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:29,792
- Yaah!
- Go, Teddy, blast them!

1037
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,417
Whoa. Amazing.

1038
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,458
Christmas, 73% better.

1039
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:42,417
Almost there, just one last thing needed.
Follow me, guys!

1040
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,958
Yay!

1041

1045
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,917
How did a girl so naughty
get a full stocking?

1046
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,917
That is a good question.

1047
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,708
<i>So, while Sam is sorting out
her mystery,</i>

1048
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:11,208
<i>poor Danny is wondering

1049
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:13,083
<i>on Christmas Day.</i>

1050
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:16,833
<i>Or is he?</i>

1051
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,125
Carol singers.

1052
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:51,458
Beware the wrath of my furled umbrella.

1053
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:55,625
Williams.

1054
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,458
Um...

1055
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,792
Hello, Ms. Trapper,
I wondered if you'd like some company?

1056
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,708
What about your mother?

1057
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:11,083
Working. And we had a bit of a fight.

1058
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:12,875
A-And your father?

1059
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,125
He didn't come.

1060
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:17,500
My mum and I
are going to have dinner later

1061
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:21,458
but I wondered if you'd like
some Christmas sort-of-cake?

1062
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:25,250
Because we're both sort of alone.

1063
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,583
Well...

1064
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:28,167
Um...

1065
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,958
it's a kind offer
but I'm afraid I'm very busy.

1066
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,750
Right. Sorry to disturb.

1067
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:44,167
Life's not always easy, is it, Williams?

1068
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:46,583
Not always.

1069
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:51,583
But I suspect, at the moment,
it's hardest for your mother.

1070
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:08,208
Mum, I just want...

1071
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:12,083
Nope.

1072
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:13,667
Hmm...

1073
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:36,208
An intervention called for, I think.

1074
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:38,458
Hmm.

1075
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:42,417
Let's see. Straight and... right.

1076
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,583
<i>Whenever I get gloomy with the state</i>

1077
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,083

1078
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:49,458
<i>...I think about the arrivals gate

1079
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,375
- And that's quite enough of that.
- Huh?

1080
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,792
Over to you, Nisha.

1081
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:55,167
Let's party!

1082
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,792
- Oh, yeah!
- Yay!

1083

Best Christmas ever!

1089
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,708
Christmas, 100% better.

1090
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,958
But what about the walk, Bernie?

1091
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:32,625
Hmm...

1092
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:38,875
<i>♪ Happy birthday, Jesus

1093
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,708
I must remember to put in my journal:

1094
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:44,667
"Pray for reincarnation
in a tropical country."

1095
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,917
Ooh! Good time for presents,
don't you think?

1096
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,125
- What?
- Presents?

1097
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:53,292
Oh.

1098
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:54,625
Merry Christmas, my love.

1099
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,792
What's this?

1100
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,375
Oh, just in case we got stuck.

1101
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,138
Couldn't have you
waking up without a gift.

1102
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,667
And I noticed the screen on your old one
was a little bit cracked.

1103
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,208
What? It's a phone? Is it charged?

1104
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,625
It certainly is. Yep.
Synced and ready to go.

1105
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,428
So we could have called
the kids last night?

1106
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Uh... Yeah, but then it wouldn't have been
a surprise, would it?

1107
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,500
Surprise!

1108
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:16,226
Well, it was nicely wrapped
at least, wasn't it?

1109
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,810
The man is a moron
and there's no getting around it.

1110
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:21,167
The kids aren't answering.
Something's wrong.

1111
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,500
Can we please call emergency services now?

1112
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,625
<i>You are 520 in the queue.</i>

1113
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,167
<i>- Please hold.</i>
- Everyone must be snowed in.

1114
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,792
We'll be here for days.

1115
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,268
Right, try Trapper. She'll have a number
for school emergencies.

1116
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:37,292
Ms. Trapper is scary.

1117
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,833
Mm, but the school is outstanding.

1118
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,792
You are such children.

1119
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,167
Be careful, Harry.

1120
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,458
Hello, is that Ms. Trapper?

1121
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,625
Yes, what do you want?
I'm very busy indeed.

1122
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,708
Oh, yes. Sorry.

1123
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:55,333
Sorry to disturb. Gosh.

1124
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,625
Oh, yes, i-it's Harry Forrest here,
Scarlett and Teddy's dad.

1125
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,083
Harry, what did she say?

1126
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,750
Yes. Yes, I did maths with you,
that's right, yes. That's the one.

1127
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,167
18th out of 18, yes.

1128
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,958
Hopeless Harry, yes.

1129
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:11,833
Yes, but I wonder
if you might be able to help.

1130
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,750
We're a little bit stuck.

1131
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:17,375
Well, as I said, I'm very busy
but if you really are desperate...

1132
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:19,125
<i>Yes! We're desperate.</i>

1133
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,000
Very well, I may have one thought.

1134
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,458
Faster, Williams.

1135
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,958
I hate turkeys.

1136
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,750
I hate their beaks, feathers...

1137
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,708
- Ms. Trapper.
- Hello, Yirrell.

1138
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:36,708
I need you to rescue some villagers
who are stuck in the snow.

1139
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:37,917
W-Why should I?

1140
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,917
Because I tell you to.

1141
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:42,583
Happy to help, Miss.

1142
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:45,583
Good. Now snap to it, you infamous oik.

1143
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,417
Yes, Miss. Thank you, Miss. Will do, Miss.

1144
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:53,542
Sometimes, it's very helpful
to be a terrifying old trout.

1145
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:58,917
Yes, that'll do.

1146
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,958
Here are the coordinates
of the McNutt van.

1147
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:04,167
Go and rescue them. Chop chop.

1148
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,375
Yes, Ms. Trapper.

1149
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,042
Right, Williams, time to get to work.

1150
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,750
But I don't think it's fair
that I have to work on Christmas Day.

1151
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,333
Precisely. Nobody should
have to work on Christmas Day.

1152
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:17,417
Including your mother.

1153
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,917
Now, take a look at this.

1154
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,417
But we'll never get it done in time.

1155
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,000
Of course we will, Master Williams.

1156
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,625
It's time for Project Homecoming.

1157
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:40,500
I can't believe you tidied up
my side of the room.

1158
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,000
It's unhealthy being this clean.

1159
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:48,250
{\an8}Charlie Beccles' Operation Happy Sam.

1160
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,125
Tactics and Plans?

1161
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,875
Operation Help Buddy.

1162
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:55,250
Operation Nisha's Melon Drop.

1163
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:58,375
Operation Match Making? To Do?

1164
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,042
Gosh.

1165
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:06,851
She's doing it all for me?

1166
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,500
What? How did that get there?

1167
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:11,583
I've got my slimy eye on you.

1168
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,750
What? What?

1169
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,917
Sam, you're being weird.

1170
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,750
Hmm. Whatever.

1171
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:28,708
<i>Clever girl, that Sam.</i>

1172
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,833
<i>I hoped she'd figure it out in the end.</i>

1173
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,792
Hurry, Williams. Hurry!

1174
01:03:47,292 --> 01:03:51,375
Absolutely love chivalry.

1175
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:53,708
What?

1176
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,000
Thank God. Someone's here.

1177
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,083
Oh, the emergency services.

1178
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,958
We're saved.

1179
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:03,625
- Help! Over here!
- Hello! We're over here! Hello!

1180
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,875
Yes! Hallelujah.

1181
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:09,208
We are so glad to see you.

1182
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,792
I hear you lot are in a bit of a pickle.

1183
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,250
- Is that Yirrell?
- What?

1184
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,083
Hello there, Hopeless Harry,

1185
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,042
I've come to rescue you.

1186
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,000
For a small fee, of course.

1187
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,750
Small fee?

1188
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:22,833
Oh, no.

1189
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,292
- We're going down!
- It's sinking!

1190
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,375
Oh, God.

1191
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,958
- Yep.
- Somewhat anticlimactic.

1192
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:35,583
Now, where to?

1193
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,792
Home!

1194
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,250
- Everyone ready?
- Um...

1195
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,083
- And walk!
- Do we have to?

1196
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,875
- Hup, two, three, four.
- Great.

1197
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,708
Hup, two, three, four.

1198
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:47,792
- And... home, two, three, four.
- Nice.

1199
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:48,708
Plot twist.

1200
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:49,792
What a legend.

1201
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,833
What? Uh...

1202
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,083
But I...

1203
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,042
That was brilliant!

1204
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,125
- Bernie is a creative genius.
- So much fun!

1205
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:00,458
But we didn't even get
to the lovely beach huts.

1206
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,208
Next year, little one.

1207
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:06,875
Right! Time for the epic
Christmas hide-and-seek!

1208
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,667
Winner gets the last bag
of fun size Mars bars!

1209
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,875
- My specialty!
- Let's go!

1210
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:12,792
Quick!

1211
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:13,708
Thirty,

1212
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,750
29, 28...

1213
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,833
- 27, 26...
- Sorry, taken.

1214
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:21,417
- 25...
- Somewhere else, Evie.

1215
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,167
24, 23...

1216
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,167
- 22...
- Huh.

1217
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,042
21, 20...

1218
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,292
19,

1219
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:34,292
18, 17...

1220
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,667
16,

1221
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,042
15...

1222
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,750
14, 13...

1223
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,333
12...

1224
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,583
What?

1225
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,292
Oh...

1226
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,542
Mum, you're here.

1227
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:13,917
Look what we made.

1228
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,750
Oh, Danny.

1229
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,792
I don't know what to say.

1230
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,500
Then don't say anything.

1231
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,625
Just step inside, Nurse Williams,

1232
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:42,583
and enjoy a very special Christmas dinner
with your most excellent son.

1233
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,333
Will you join us?

1234
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Uh, maybe next year.

1235
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:56,333
I-I've got some catching up to do
with my own family.

1236
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,792
Ms. Trapper, are you sure?

1237
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,833
Merry Christmas, Williams.

1238
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:08,250
It's time to celebrate the wins
and live with the losses.

1239
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Come here.

1240
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,083
We're going to be so fine.

1241
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,125
I think so too.

1242
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,250
Your throne, madam.

1243
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,958
Oh...

1244
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:14,750
Merry Christmas, Jamie.

1245
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,625
- First to the little girls' room.
- Whew.

1246
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:30,208
Oh! Absolutely love you,
Beyoncé, old girl.

1247
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,542
We're home!

1248
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,542
What on Earth has happened here?

1249
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,958
Oh, no! We've been burgled!

1250
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:39,500
You're home!

1251
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,750
You're back!

1252
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:44,917
Oh, Nisha <i>beta,</i> I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1253
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,667
I'll never leave you alone
at Christmas again.

1254
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,042
- Mummy!
- I love you, sweetie.

1255
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,792
And clearly you managed to have <i>some</i> fun.

1256
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:57,417
- Yeah. Bernie was fantastic.
- We had a disco!

1257
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,333
- She is my absolute hero.
- Aw...

1258
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:03,042
Well, there's nothing quite as good
as a traditional Christmas, is there?

1259
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,667
There certainly isn't.

1260
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,625
Wait a minute. Where's Evie?

1261
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,917
- Yeah. Where is that little pumpkin?
- Evie!

1262
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,292
- Evie! Come out!
- Why is the door unlocked?

1263
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,167
- Eve!
- Evie!

1264
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,167
Eve.

1265
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,333
Oh, no.

1266
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:22,934
When was the last time someone saw Evie?

1267
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Evie!

1268
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:27,458
- Evie!
- Evie!

1269
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:28,583
Evie!

1270
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:30,500
We were just playing hide-and-seek.

1271
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,708
I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry.

1272
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,542
It's okay. We just need to find her.

1273
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,000
She's not in the house.

1274
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,417
Oh, my gosh.

1275
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,375
Get Ms. Trapper onto the school WhatsApp.

1276
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,292
Kids, DM your friends.

1277
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,208
We need all the help we can get.

1278
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:45,667
Find my Evie. Please.

1279
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,583
She'll turn up. I'm 100% certain.

1280
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:52,333
It's all my fault.
It was asking too much of Bernie.

1281
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:54,875
Bernie!

1282
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:55,792
Evie!

1283
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,875
Bernie, wait! Please.

1284
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:58,958
Evie!

1285
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,625
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- We'll find her.

1286
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,042
- Stick together!
- Be careful!

1287
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,708
Danny, we need you
and we need your monster-quad monstrosity.

1288
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,583
Eve McNutt is missing.

1289
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:33,750
- Let's go.
- Evie.

1290
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,792
Evie! Come to Charlie!

1291
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,000
I've got lots of sweets!

1292
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,476
- Charlie.
- Come on, Charlie.

1293
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Please be serious,
this is no time for naughtiness.

1294
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,500
- Good.
- She's here.

1295
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,750
Don't worry.

1296
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,208
Right, spread out,
form a line, two meters apart.

1297
01:10:58,292 --> 01:10:59,958
Mustn't miss a spot!

1298
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:01,708
Hurry!

1299
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:05,250
Maintain your distance and hold the line.

1300
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,667
Eve! Evie.

1301
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,125
Evie-Weevie. Ice cream over here!

1302
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:12,684
- Charlie, now is not the time.
- Charlie.

1303
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,750
Stop it.

1304
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,833
No, you stop it.

1305
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:18,292
Charlie's not being naughty.
She's searching.

1306
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,208
Helping people Charlie-style,
with... with imagination.

1307
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:22,417
Well, I'm sure Dad just...

1308
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,250
Why did Santa leave her a full stocking?

1309
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:27,542
Because he knows
that Charlie isn't naughty. She's nice.

1310
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:31,250
Oh, and she actually darned well
does something about it all.

1311
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,708
- Does she?
- Do I?

1312
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:36,333
Yes, you do.
And it's because she loves me so much.

1313
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,958
Why did Charlie
step on Nisha's dress in the play?

1314
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,792
Because Nisha's mean to me
all the time and calls me the...

1315
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,125
"Boring twin."

1316
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:46,417
Exactly. Why did Charlie
drop the snow avalanche on Mrs. Horton?

1317
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,292
- Pardon?
- Because I love her dog, Buddy

1318
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,667
and she's absolutely horrible to him.

1319
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,250
Is that right, Charlie?

1320
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:54,833
Well, motivation is a complex thing.

1321
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:57,000
And when she let
Farmer Yirrell's turkeys out...

1322
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,625
- Charlie, you did not.
- Charlie Beccles...

1323
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:00,875
Yes, she did.

1324
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:04,167
And she did it because at Christmas
the poor, lovely turkeys have to die

1325
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,417
because we have to eat them on a day
when there's far too much food anyhow.

1326
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,792
Well, yes...

1327
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:12,542
So my ambition next year
is to be more like Charlie. Not less.

1328
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,583
Now, can we please just find little Evie

1329
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:18,583
and move on from this whole
negative pigeonholing extravaganza.

1330
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,792
Evie!

1331
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,417
- Oi, Sam! Wait for me!
- Evie!

1332
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,750
Evie! Evie!

1333
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,125
Need a lift?

1334
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:35,250
That is, only if it's convenient.

1335
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,333
I mean, maybe?

1336
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:38,292
If that suits?

1337
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:39,625
Oh. Uh...

1338
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:41,583
Thank you for standing up for me.

1339
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,917
Evie, come on, where are you?

1340
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,042
You're the best sister ever.

1341
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:51,792
Now, just get on the bike
with Romeo, Juliet.

1342
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:00,208
Beccles twins to the rescue!

1343
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,750
Yee-haw!

1344
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:06,333
- Evie! Evie!
- Evie!

1345
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,083
It's no use.

1346
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,125
We'll never find her when it's this dark.

1347
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,792
But we must keep going.

1348
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,625
I can't see anything.

1349
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,250
That's it.

1350
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:21,333
That is it. Hold tight.

1351
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,542
Mr. Bill! Please!

1352
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,708
Help! Hello! Mr. Bill?

1353
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,934
- I'm coming.
- Oh, he's coming.

1354
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:46,875
- Coming.
- Yes!

1355
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:47,958
Hold your horses.

1356
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:48,875
Mr. Bill!

1357
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,417
Evie McNutt is missing.

1358
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,125
And it's super dark.

1359
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,292
- Kids?
- And you've got a super light.

1360
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:55,500
Oh, well, co...

1361
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,125
Come in.

1362
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:01,708
Come on, Mr. Bill.

1363
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:03,167
Use this.

1364
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,208
Thank you.

1365
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,667
Sorry about the mess.

1366
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,625
Come on, Gertrude. Time to sparkle.

1367
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:16,708
- Huh?
- Go that way.

1368
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,292
There's Bernie.

1369
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,958
- Evie!
- Evie!

1370
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,167
Follow her, Mr. Bill.

1371
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,792
Come on, Mr. Bill. Hurry.

1372
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,292
- There's something in the snow.
- Where?

1373
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,583
Further left, further left!

1374
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:45,875
Look. There!

1375
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,750
- We've got to go help her.
- Let's go!

1376
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:50,250
Evie! Evie!

1377
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,458
Evie!

1378
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:02,292
Pink bird.

1379
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,625
Evie!

1380
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,750
Oh, God.

1381
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:30,917
Oh, Evie.

1382
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:36,375
Evie!

1383
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,250
There she is.

1384
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,708
Bernie!

1385
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:44,125
Bernie! Are you okay?

1386
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,708
Evie? Where is she?

1387
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,292
We'll keep looking. We'll find her.

1388
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,815
- It's all my fault.
- She's out there, I know.

1389
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,208
Look over there!

1390
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:58,458
Look where he's pointing the light.

1391
01:15:58,542 --> 01:16:00,042
There's something moving.

1392
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,958
Evie!

1393
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:05,958
Evie!

1394
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,333
Evie!

1395
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:25,625
The beach huts.

1396
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:45,208
Bernie, all the big birdies! Look!

1397
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:51,792
Evie.

1398
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,375
Evie.

1399
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,750
Mummy!

1400
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,625
Oh, Evie, my darling.

1401
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:02,792
We found her!
We found her at the beach huts!

1402
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,083
They found her!

1403
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:05,917
- She's safe.
- She's here.

1404
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,750
They've got her! They found her!

1405
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,542
Did I win hide-and-seek?

1406
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,292
Yes, darling.

1407
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:14,125
You very much won.

1408
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,667
Come here, you life-saving
feathery superhero.

1409
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,250
Oh! Ooh! Ow!

1410
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:21,292
Absolutely love turkeys.

1411
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,833
I'm so sorry I lost her.

1412
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,125
I'm so stupid.

1413
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:32,042
I forgot the only thing that matters.

1414
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,333
No. No.

1415
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:37,375
The only thing that matters
is that you found her.

1416
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,792
And you gave the kids
an amazing Christmas, Bernadette.

1417
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,708
I'm so proud of you.

1418
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,417
Eve family sandwich!

1419
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,542
Mmm.

1420
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,375
Aw. Isn't that wonderful?

1421
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,208
Yes, it really is.

1422
01:17:56,458 --> 01:17:58,500
- Danny Williams.
- Yes?

1423
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,375
Was the lighthouse light really your idea?

1424
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,500
Uh...

1425
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,250
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1426
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,792
Ladies and gentlemen,

1427
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:11,375
this is Danny,
the best person in Wellington-on-Sea.

1428
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,958
That's your cue. Go for it.

1429
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:15,833
Uh...

1430
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,625
Um...

1431
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:21,167
Sam, I was wondering,

1432
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,417
maybe we could get together
for some...

1433
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,917
f-for some wine gums sometime?

1434
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,208
Um... Wrong twin, chickpea.

1435
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:32,167
Over here. But yes, that'd be great.

1436
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:45,000
<i>And that was</i> That Christmas.

1437
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:48,917
<i>One that will live long
in the memory down Wellington way</i>

1438
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,083
<i>and prove that the best Christmases
aren't really about presents</i>

1439
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:56,042
<i>and that splendid fellow called Santa.</i>

1440
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:59,958
<i>They're about being with the people
you love. In the place you love.</i>

1441
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:02,375
<i>And a time for local heroes.</i>

1442
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:05,875
<i>Like the one whose caring soul
gave my friend Bill</i>

1443
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,708
<i>one last Christmas with his Mum.</i>

1444
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:15,542
<i>But one more wrinkle remained.</i>

1445
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,042
<i>The traditional crazy Boxing Day sea swim.</i>

1446
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:24,125
<i>This year, for the very first time,
obviously, no one was going to show up.</i>

1447
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:29,083
<i>Well, except for one fearless,
skinny old sea dog, of course.</i>

1448
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:32,792
<i>Even if it meant doing it on his own,
he'd never miss it.</i>

1449
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,083
Come on, guys! Come on!

1450
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,958
- Hi, Bill.
- Hello.

1451
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,417
Happy Christmas, Bill.

1452
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,958
Are you braving it?

1453
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,750
<i>Well, what do you know?</i>

1454
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:48,833
<i>I thought Wellington-on-Sea
was just an ordinary town</i>

1455
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,125
<i>I'd drop in on once a year.</i>

1456
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,083
<i>But I was very wrong.</i>

1457
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:56,167
<i>It turns out
it's a rather remarkable community.</i>

1458
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,500
<i>Where the only gift
they ever really needed was each other.</i>

1459
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:02,958
Here you go, little monster.
No more escaping, Evie.

1460
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:05,833
<i>And a real community is for life.</i>

1461
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,000
<i>Not just for Christmas.</i>

1462
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:09,625
I love it.

1463
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There you go, my love.

1464
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:13,583
Such a nice young man.

1465
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:22,875
Come on, Danny. Let's do it.

1466
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,333
Yeah!

1467
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,250
Oh, it's flipping cold.

1468
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,458
Whoa!

1469
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:39,542
Mission accomplished.

1470
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,625
It's amazing!

1471
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:50,833
Come on, follow me.

1472
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:52,917
Last one in is a loser.

1473
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,708
- That'll be you then!
- Oof.

1474
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:56,000
Kids, wait!

1475
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,601
I'm not so sure, to be honest.

1476
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,185
- Come on, big chicken.
- Please... Ooh!

1477
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:02,875
Mummy, hold this.

1478
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,875
- Whoo!
- Happy hypothermia.

1479
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,625
Oh!

1480
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:19,208
Ms. Trapper,
thanks for looking out for my Danny.

1481
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,125
Merry Christmas.

1482
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:24,583
Yes. It has been, hasn't it?

1483
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:29,000
And now I believe it's time for a swim.

1484
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,792
Chocks away!

1485
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,417
I think you're right.
Let's show them how it's done!

1486
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:38,542
Look at me, I'm Christmas-Eve!

1487
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,583
Absolutely love a happy ending.

Are you talking to yourself again, Sants?
