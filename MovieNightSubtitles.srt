3
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,423
My daughter.

4
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,425
What are you drawing?

5
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,178
The pretty flower
I saw in your notebook, Papa.

6
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,473
- That's the corpse flower, Wei.
Remember?

7
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,768
- So, it makes itself smelly

8
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,602
to attract flies?

9
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,562
- Flesh flies.

10
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,939
- And they love it?

11
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,025
- Yes, they do.

12
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,779
- Can I go feed the snake?

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
- Well, fine. Come on.

14
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,008
OK, Wei.

15
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,094
Dad is going back to work.

16
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,264
You go finish your maths.

17
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:23,769
- Dad, are you going to
fix your face?

18
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,021
- Not just my face, Wei.

19
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,108
I will fix yours too.

20
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,747
Wei.

21
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,574
- Dad!

22
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,042
Dad!

23
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,863
Ling, but she's your niece.

24
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,615
She won't be any trouble,
I promise.

25
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,576
I would have loved to
keep her here with me,

26
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,787
but what can I do with her here?
You've seen her.

27
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,998
You know what they call her?

28
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,084
A monster.

29
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,734
Hi, Wei!

30
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,111
Here! Here!

31
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,615
Here is my ugly little car.

32
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,494
I used to drive a Lexus.

33
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,246
Come on. Your suitcase.

34
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,457
Do you remember the
last time I saw you?

35
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,751
You were smaller
than this suitcase.

36
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,960
Do you remember?

37
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,920
- Uh-huh...

38
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,800
- That was also the last time
I saw your father.

39
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,009
If he knew that you've
got the scholarship,

40
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,221
he would be so proud of you.

41
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,100
You have to become
a scientist like he did.

42
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,021
Come, let me have a look.

43
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,489
What a pretty scarf.

44
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
You know what?

45
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,742
I sell excellent
concealer products

46
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,079
which can cover it right up!

47
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,751
Well, you're tired.
Let's go home.

48
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,931
I warn you, the house is a mess.

49
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,726
Angela's useless father left us
in the middle of renovations.

50
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,479
And now I can't afford
to finish them.

51
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,566
Arsehole!

52
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,529
It's so great to have you here.

53
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,738
You'll be good company
for Angela.

54
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,866
She's not talking
to me at the moment.

55
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,451
She goes out all the time,
doesn't want any part-time jobs.

56
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,539
You will set a great
example for her.

57
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,584
And we're home.

58
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,004
You see what the bastard
left me to deal with?

59
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,672
I keep telling your cousin this.

60
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,508
You have to work very hard
and have your career.

61
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,012
In this way, you don't need to
rely on anyone in the future.

62
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,098
This is my house.

63
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,391
For now, don't mind the mess.

64
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,059
When Angela's dad ditched us,

65
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,522
we were in the middle
of the renovations.

66
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,859
Well, that's a story
for another day.

67
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,613
That's our neighbour, Sheryl.

68
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,949
She's cheaper
than a real gardener.

69
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,745
I'm expanding
my beauty products business.

70
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,123
Our future is in these boxes.

71
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,959
Come in!

72
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,671
Bloody annoying dog.

73
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,466
Stop barking!

74
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,869
Ugh! Look at that ugly hole.

75
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,039
A few more sales and I'll have
my beautiful French doors.

76
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,644
Papa, please watch over me

77
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,855
on my first day of university.

78
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,107
I'll get some char siu soon,
but in the meantime,

79
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,653
please try some yummy
New Zealand food.

80
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,637
Papa, I'm going to
make you so proud!

81
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:57,121
Papa, please. I need your help.

82
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,794
I miss you.

83
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,438
My daughter.

84
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,524
What are you drawing?

85
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,905
The pretty flower
I saw in your notebook, Papa.

86
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,492
Papa, I remember
the corpse flower now.

87
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,704
I will mend myself,
and you'll be so proud of me.

88
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,723
Wake up, Angela!

89
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,976
Wake up, please, Angela.

90
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,520
Angela.

91
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,607
Papa, what should I do?

92
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,111
Please help me, Papa.
What should I do?

93
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,764
Don't worry, Angela.

94
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,849
I can fix this.

95
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,936
I will bring you back.

96
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,479
I did it.

97
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,522
I did it, Papa.

98
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,650
Look at me.

99
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:21,269
Where's my notebook?

100
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,647
Where the fuck is my notebook?!

101
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:26,230
Shut the fuck up, Bikkie!

102
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,119
I will find
your notebook, Father.

103
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,914
I promise you,
I will make him pay.

104
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,251
Are you proud of me, Father?

105
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,170
Look how beautiful I am now.

106
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,172
Shut the fuck up, Bikkie!

107
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:17,644
- Bikkie. Bikkie.

108
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,943
Shut the fuck up, Bikkie.

109
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,953
Papa, I need your help.

110
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:45,221
I'm so sorry!

111
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,020
Sorry. Sorry.

112
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:19,790
