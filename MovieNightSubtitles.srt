00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,489
Long ago, the duke of Milan
commissioned a little-known artist...

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,368
to erect a mammoth statue
of a horse.

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,914
The time was 1481.

4
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,668
The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,297
The guy on the donkey
is just a guy on a donkey.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,052
Anyway, they called this statue
the Sforza...

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,390
and it was gonna be
the largest bronze statue ever built.

8
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,975
But wouldn't you know it...

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,188
war broke out,
and bronze became scarce.

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,441
So da Vinci decided
to create a machine...

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,236
to change common lead
into bronze.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,491
But when da Vinci
finally turned this machine on...

13
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,953
it was to give him something
more than he expected.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,292
Something much more than bronze.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,505
Leonardo, che pazzo!

16
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,181

as the Hudson Hawk.

everything in there.

276
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,998
- and I'm robbing an auction house.
- Let's go, Hawk.

277
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,876
Hey, Dean, I don't get it.

278
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,045
I'm looking at the auction room,
and I see that little blue chair.

279
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,048
I didn't wanna do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

280
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,258
Snap out of it!

281
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,261
You think that's strange,
check out screen two.

282
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,846
Hey, that's us.

283
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,764
- Somebody rewired the recorders.
- Shit!

284
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,132
I hold you responsible, Tommy.

285
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,977

Let's take it home.

286
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:59,358
♪ You could be

287
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,072
Hey!

288
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,209
- Let's go out the back way.
- Keep those ideas coming.

289
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,253
Get up. You're embarrassing me.

290
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,675
- Would you get going!
- Come on, go!

291
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,221
- Go, go, go.
- Easy with that.

292
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,392
Come on! Beat it, Tommy!
Come on!

293
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,645
I can't tell you how happy I am
that we covered our tracks.

294
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,525
- Can I ask a question?
- What?

295
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,486
I'm not as fat as that guard, am I?

296
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,947
Oh, no. You're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

297
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,577
Come on, Slim Jim.

298
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,883
Hudson Hawk gets
the chair of honor.

299
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,469
Good job. Not pretty, but good.

300
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,348
All this trouble for a horsey.

301
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,769
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

302
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,562
- You certainly do.
- So...

303
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,442
when's this Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace-looking,
butler-head motherfucker getting here?

304
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,654
Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

305
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,329
- Sorry, Jeeves.
- May I?

306
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,000
Exquisite.

307
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:45,297
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the duke of Milan.

308
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,133
Irreplaceable.

309
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,845
Hey, Mr. French. I'm...

310
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,847
What the...? What.?

311
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes...

312
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,852
You son of a bitch.

313
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,439
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards.

314
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,816
Now, where's my cut?

315
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,869
So much for his cut.

316
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,038
Forgive my dry British humor.

317
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,419
You know, I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut too.

318
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,220
Lovely work, Alfred.
You taking the Concorde back?

319
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,431
Always, Mr. Mario.

320
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,729
I'm really racking up
those frequent-flier points.

321
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,815
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

322
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,736
Yo, Five-Tone.

323
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,779
Did I miss anything?

324
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,408
Gates tries to blackmail me.
You ask me, "Did I miss anything?"

325
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,743
Gates gets killed.

326
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,745
You say, "Did I miss anything?"

327
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,330
I bet you'd go up to
Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre:

328
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,583
And say, "How was the show?
Did I miss anything?"

329
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,050
- You may wanna get this looked at.
- Jeez, Gates was killed?

330
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,927
So who do we send
a thank-you note to?

331
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,220
The butler did it.

332
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,056
Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

333
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,392
Took Mr. Ed, Humpty-Dumptied it
over Gates' head, and get this:

334
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,647
- He said it was made by Leonardo...
- Da Vinci's Sforza.

335
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,094
I consider it to be the prize...

336
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,611
of tonight's auction
of objets d'equestrian.

337
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,363
Horse things.

338
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,949
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

339
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,408
Morning edition.

340
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,912
It says here, two thieves
attempted to steal it last night...

341
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,290
but thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

342
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,875
Attempted?

343
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:49,296
I didn't wanna steal the goddamned thing in
the first place, but I do have my pride.

344
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,798
I don't understand this.

345
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,591
Why try? Forget about it.

346
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,553
Because I'm tired of not
understanding things. Cops, Mafia...

347
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,160
butlers forcing me to steal something which
now it appears I didn't steal after all.

348
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,851
It's all too goddamn
peculiar, Tommy.

349
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,380
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

350
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,896
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

351
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,733
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

352
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:14,613
Now, who will start at 140,000?

353
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,490
Hundred-and-forty thousand.

354
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,075
Hundred-and-sixty thousand?

355
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,745
Seventy? Eighty? Ninety thousand.

356
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,164
Two hundred?

357
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,709
Twenty.

358
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,376
Forty.

359
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,592
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand.

360
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,429
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand?
Sixty thousand?

361
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,723
Seventy? Eighty?

362
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,643
Ninety? Three hundred thousand.
Three-ten.

363
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,978
Sold.

364
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,063
You know, after all these years...

365
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,233
I still get goose bumps
coming to these auctions.

366
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,820
The paintings, the sculptures...

367
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,364
Things that aren't really
paintings or sculptures.

368
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,243
Pretentious vultures who never look up from
their calculators to see what they're buying.

369
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,288
Now, that gives me goose bumps.

370
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,956
Auctions are disgusting.

371
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,583
I couldn't agree more.

372
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,627
Savages.

373
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,838
Now, lot 15.

374
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:18,093
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Trillini school.

375
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,764
Now, who will start at 250,000?

376
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,350
Two-hundred-fifty thousand.
Eighty thousand.

377
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,185
Thank you, sir.

378
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,479
Three hundred thousand.
Three-twenty.

379
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,315
Three-forty thousand.

380
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,901
No more on 340,000?

381
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,029
Sold once. Twice.

382
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,906
Sold.

383
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,202
And finally, lot number 17.

384
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,291
Thought to be lost in the war,
and again last night.

385
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,296
The da Vinci Sforza,
the jewel of the sale.

386
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,839
Fantastic.

387
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,841
Is looking like
a constipated warthog...

388
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
a prerequisite for getting a job
in the art world?

389
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,391
Doctoressa Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?

390
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,519
Some of us warthogs are
more constipated than others.

391
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,623
Oh, shit.

392
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,921
Perfection.

393
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,050
The Vatican extends its jealousy
to the lucky bidder.

394
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,844
Thank you, doctor.

395
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:47,474
We'll begin the bidding
at $20 million. To you, sir.

396
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,811
- Twenty-point-five.
- Waldo!

397
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,314
One hundred million clams.

398
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:59,194
That's $100 million
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

399
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:07,035
One hundred million and one, Waldo.

400
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,037
Fantastic.

401
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,583
One hundred million dollars
and one.

402
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,168
Outbid by mine own wench.

403
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,586
Quelle bummer.

404
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,964
Don't hate me, baby.

405
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,469
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

406
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,471
Any other bids?

407
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,181
Going once.

408
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:40,110
Going twice.

409
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,612
Gone.

410
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,678
My God. That was bold of you.

411
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,931
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's nothing.

412
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,618
Anybody would have
done the same thing.

413
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,227
No, I mean, you didn't
have to tackle me and rip my dress.

414
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,482
I'm just kidding.
Thanks for saving me, tough guy.

415
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,942
Why was that guard chasing you?

416
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,735
Because danger, doc,
is my middle...

417
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,587
Couldn't just play along,
could you, Eddie?

418
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,508
You gotta admit, Eddie. Classy way
of covering our tracks?

419
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,595
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at La Guardia any minute now.

420
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,599
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

421
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,612
Get the fuck out of here.

422
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,324
You stupid ass!

423
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,127
- Menthol.
- Hey!

424
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,339
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

425
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,260
Hey, mister. Are you gonna die?

426
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,021
Happy sailing, Hawk!

427
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,480
No! Oh, no!

428
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,773
How am I driving?

429
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,401
1-800-I'm-gonna-fucking-die!

430
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,614
Toll booth?!

431
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,248
Exact change?!

432
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,095
Make him roadkill.

433
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,597
Up yours, Cesar.

434
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,682
Yeah, run him down.

435
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,617
Cesar! Antony!

436
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,035
Are you okay?

437
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,874
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

438
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,771
The name's Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.

439
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,859
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

440
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,654
Well, it's better
than when we first started out.

441
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,489
Our code names were diseases.

442
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,993
Do you know what it's like
being called Chlamydia for a year?

443
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,953
Oops, forgot.

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,095
- My's Butterfinger.
- No shit.

445
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,894
Do you like
the company's new look?

446
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,230
I call them the "MTV-IA."

447
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,523
George, you promised.

448
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,693
No old-CIA/new-CIA jokes.

449
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,780
Punks. They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

450
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,616
and the Cold War has something
to do with penguins.

451
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,993
Don't I know you?

452
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,705
The last time you saw me, I was bald
with a beard and no mustache...

453
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,832
and I had a different nose.

454
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,793
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

455
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,171
My high school science teacher?

456
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,091
I'm the guy who tricked you into
robbing the government installation...

457
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,469
and then had you
sent to prison for it.

458
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,429
George Kaplan.

459
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,310
I'm not the type
to hold a grudge, George.

460
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,313
I used you as a diversion.

461
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,732
I guess down deep,
I was just jealous.

462
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,069
You were one hell of a thief.

463
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,946
To what do I owe
the dishonor of this reunion, Georgie?

464
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,200
I wanna make it up to you, kid.
That's why I got you this gig.

465
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,911
And to quote the late, great
Karen Carpenter:

466
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,913
"We have only just begun."

467
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,040
Three minutes, four seconds.

468
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,968
Well you know, George,
you're a little late.

469
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,294
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

470
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,006
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

471
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,802
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

472
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,889
Good God, what's that?

473
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,851
Now George, you don't expect me
to fall for that old gag, do you?

474
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,561
Shucks, I guess not.

475
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,065
Now?

476
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes, now.

477
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,792
No way.

478
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,670
Welcome to Rome, sir.

479
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:41,114
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

480
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,619
Why did you duck
at the auction house, asshole?

481
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,705
What can I tell you. I'm the villain.

482
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,917
Initially, it was a priority to keep
a lot of buffers between you and me.

483
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,878
But since most of them are dead now,
I thought, what the heck?

484
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,381
Hawkie, you come
highly recommended.

485
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,719
I hired Kaplan and the Mario brothers
to find me a cat burglar.

486
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,972
Hey. I want to be in business
with you.

487
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:20,695
♪ I've got the power ♪

488
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,412
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
and Minerva...

489
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,499
let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

490
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,087
Minerva.

491
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,630
Minerva!

492
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:44,344
Hello. Bunny, ball-ball.

493
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,637
So, Hawkmeister...

494
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,639
we got you clothes, great hotel...

495
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,684
and a 250,000-lire per diem.

496
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,018
That's $200 a day.

497
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,104
So he can get a hooker
and some tequila?

498
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,647
Veto, Darwin.

499
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,318
I guess we see who wears
the penis in this family?

500
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,905
For God's sake,
somebody chain this convict.

501
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,992
Listen, Hawkie.

502
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,954
This might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular joe.

503
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,125
I just want to be happy.

504
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,501
And happiness comes...

505
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,503
from the achieving of goals.

506
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,426
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

507
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,387
it's hard to keep
coming up with new ones.

508
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:32,142
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal:

509
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,020
World domination!

510
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,489
Shut up!

511
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,701
- Bunny, quit that.
- Bunny, ball-ball.

512
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,911
I think Bunny's got
today's ball-balls.

513
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,081
- Bad Bunny.
- Bunny, you weren't that bad.

514
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,335
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

515
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:03,256
But seriously, folks, Concorde me
back home, put me in jail. I don't care.

516
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,469
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

517
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:12,766
You'll have a Guinea barkeep
cellmate to keep you company.

518
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,518
You're young enough to still enjoy
shanking child molesters...

519
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,105
for a pack of smokes.

520
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,274
But Tommy Five-Tone...

521
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,860
will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

522
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,946
will be to attend
his own funeral.

523
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,037
Depressing?

524
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,000
I wouldn't waste a dime
for the phone call.

525
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,086
You don't have any proof.

526
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,546
The magic word.

527
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,467
It's "véjà du," Hawkhead:
Something you wish never did happen.

528
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,638
Kaplan and his CIA candy bars shot
the entire operation with hidden cameras.

529
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,643
They put the fake horse in the safe while
you clowns were running from the guards.

530
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,524
Yikes.

531
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,192
Damn Fotomat assholes.

532
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,760
That's a good shot of you, Minerva.

533
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,239
My man, you're going
to hit a church.

534
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,908
We want you to steal
da Vinci's sketchbook...

535
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,620
the Codex.

536
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,789
The Vatican.

537
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,792
I'm robbing
the freaking Vatican.

538
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,461
The nuns at St. Agnes...

539
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,338
predicted this.

540
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,674
What do they call you guys,
Igg and Ook?

541
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,247
- Hey, man.
- Buon giorno.

542
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,582
Yeah, buon giorno.

543
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,083
I'm being blackmailed
into robbing the Vatican...

544
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,086
by a psychotic
American corporation and the CIA.

545
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,839
I don't...

546
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,967
That's okay, colonel.
Just keep an eye on all the art.

547
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,271
Courtney, stop it.

548
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,232
You're embarrassing
your country.

549
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,661
Though Leonardo
is best known as a painter...

550
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,955
it was his gift as an inventor...

551
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,583
who drew together
science and art...

552
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,127
that is most incredible.

553
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,009
Tough guy.

554
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,095
What are you doing here?

555
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,848
You know, every time I get around you,
my heart starts beating really fast.

556
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,437
As you know,
the Da Vinci Codex...

557
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,775
has lived in the Vatican for centuries, and
will continue to live here for centuries more.

558
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,944
That's what you think.

559
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,072
- Question, sir?
- Yeah, what time do you get done?

560
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,075
His untiring pen
predicted the airplane...

561
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,744
the submarine, the bicycle...

562
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,414
the helicopter
and even the tank.

563
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,791
These more dangerous designs
inspired him...

564
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,334
Pokey!

565
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,559
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Quickly, come with me.

566
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,603
Pokey, come back!

567
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,025
Is that smoke bad for you?

568
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,890
- This way.
- Where are we going?

569
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,278
Through here.

570
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,747
Are you gonna tell me why you did that back
there, or are you gonna blame it on Dumbo?

571
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,290
You mean Pokey?

572
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,043
You believe that
kooky little elephant?

573
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,839
- What in the world is this?
- It's a postal subway.

574
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,217
- Can I get to Times Square from here?
- No.

575
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,094
The pope takes his mail seriously.

576
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,096
Christmas cards, Easter Seals.

577
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,390
Delivers up to 10 at night.

578
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,601
I see.

579
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,270
Well, actually, I don't see.
I'm very confused.

580
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,648
How do you know all this stuff?
What do you do?

581
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,275
Well, I do a lot of things.

582
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,070
But I don't steal stuffed elephants
from little girls.

583
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,447
My life's pretty boring.

584
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,575
Yeah, mine too.

585
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,495
You have dinner
with me tonight?

586
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,330
Nice, dull, boring dinner?

587
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,584
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

588
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,337
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

589
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,594
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

590
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,221
There's a place around the corner.

591
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,724
- Enzo's. Say 10:30?
- Ten-thirty.

592
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,143
Hey, thanks.

593
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,113
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

594
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,948
Report upstairs at once.

595
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,574
Yes, sir.

596
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,629
Did he mention the Mayflowers?

597
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,966
No, your eminence. He's definitely
going to steal the Codex. I can feel it.

598
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,677
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal, you mean.

599
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,221
The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk.

600
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,308
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

601
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:33,563
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

602
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:40,194
And must you flirt with him
so effectively?

603
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,155
That's the only way.

604
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:46,284
As an agent of our organization,
you are put in awkward situations.

605
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,663
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

606
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,144
Yes. Hello, operator.
I'd like to make a collect call...

607
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,647
overseas, to a New York number.

608
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,983
What? No, no, don't put me...

609
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,281
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you for calling AT&T.

610
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,033
What number
are you calling, please?

611
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,829
Thank God. 212-555-1989.

612
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:42,757
Pick up the phone, you
reindeer-goat-cheese-eating bastard.

613
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,593
Pick it up. Pick it up.

614
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,346
Pick it up, Tommy.

615
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,641
The black thing. On the desk.

616
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,186
Come on, Tommy.

617
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,785
Want a little more, Jumbo?

618
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,204
Kick your big, flabby ass.

619
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,289
Hawk.

620
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:19,585
Hawk, Hawk.

621
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,213
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

622
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,340
Yes.

623
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,302
I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Roma.

624
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,807
I did my first
bare-handed strangulation here.

625
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,684
Communist politician.

626
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,394
Why, George, you big softy.

627
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,481
God, I miss Communism.

628
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,608
The Red threat.

629
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,237
People were scared...

630
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:52,535
the agency had some respect,
and I got laid every night.

631
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,495
Brief him, Snickers.

632
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,997
Good news, Hawk.

633
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,040
Mayflowers have
moved up the timetable.

634
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,459
- You're hitting the Vatican tonight.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

635
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,503
The timing's off,
the schedule's not right...

636
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,006
I'm underequipped,
and besides that, I got a date.

637
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,757
Grapple, biker's bottle...

638
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,551
pocket fisherman, olive oil...

639
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,927
100 stamps?

640
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,138
Gee, stud, this gonna be some date.

641
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,639
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

642
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,309
Snickers, make that list happen.

643
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,895
Oh, it's one thing
to play hide-and-seek...

644
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,314
with the Mayflowers'
pathetic staff...

645
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,482
but we're sore losers.

646
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,610
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

647
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,279
You and your friend Tommy
would be nothing more than a...

648
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,323
A late-afternoon Triscuit.

649
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,866
Ciao.

650
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,827
Hey! Old man!

651
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,537
Yeah, you!

652
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,123
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

653
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,917
and I'll kick your
centrally intelligent ass...

654
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,128
up one side the piazza
and down the other!

655
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,722
"Beware the blue wire"?

656
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,768
Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.

657
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,519
Good, Yogi.

658
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,767
Now, Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

659
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,674
I was afraid
you weren't gonna drop by.

660
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,635
Am I late?

661
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,728
You look very nice.

662
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,064
You really do.

663
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,941
- What?
- I am the waiter, sir.

664
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,777
Oh, very nice.

665
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,155
Fettuccine con funghi porcini.
Prego.

666
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,450
And bring me a bottle of ketchup
with that, will you?

667
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,202
You heard him.

668
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,496
Ketchup. Ketchup.

669
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,122
Stupid Americano!

670
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,087
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

671
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,089
Steak burger.

672
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,591
French fries.

673
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,760
This is France.
You got to have french fries.

674
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,929
"Actually, it's Italy, Butterfinger,"
she said...

675
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,889
as if it made a difference.

676
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,853
To be in Paris and in love.

677
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,027
They had the worst ketchup
when I was in prison.

678
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,030
Prison?

679
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,991
I was a warden?

680
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,326
How long were you in?

681
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:53,664
Let's just say I never saw E.T.

682
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,501
You were in the joint...

683
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,255
doing hard time.

684
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,175
It's funny, but that excites me.

685
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,845
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

686
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,723
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check, please.

687
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,892
Where did you get the Hawk?

688
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,478
Ossining, New York.

689
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,398
Where did you get the
Hudson Hawk?

690
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,693
Well, a "hawk" is a slang word...

691
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,238
for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

692
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,657
I grew up in a town
called Hoboken, New Jersey...

693
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,105
which is on the Hudson River.

694
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,705
- So Hudson River, Hudson Hawk.
- Hudson Hawk.

695
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,458
And where did you get these?

696
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,251
Had a little accident
around the house.

697
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,962
- What happened?
- I fell on some chickens.

698
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,881
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

699
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,008
Maybe I can make them
feel better.

700
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,345
Well, okay. See what you can do.

701
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,191
Don't. Don't tickle me.
Don't do it.

702
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,442
Don't do it because...

703
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,736
Because I gotta
tell you something.

704
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,154
What?

705
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,406
No, I better whisper it to you.

706
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,367
Come here.

707
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,829
I can't do this.

708
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,335
What's the matter?

709
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,087
It's been a long time for me.

710
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,464
Well, it's been a really long time
for me.

711
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,426
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday
morning, this has been a very slow decade.

712
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,723
I don't make love every 10 years,
I get a little cranky.

713
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,685
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

714
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,648
Not that I ever kiss guys.

715
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,909
Catholic girls are scary.

716
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,079
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

717
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,337
This is not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

718
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,798
You went and did it.
You really did it.

719
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,093
In one day, in less than one day
of planning, and you did it.

720
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,137
You started the week
by stealing the Sforza...

721
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,184
- and ended by swiping the Codex.
- Yeah, but...

722
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,808
What are your weekend plans?
Hoisting away the Colosseum?

723
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,853
- But you don't...
- Tell me, did the devil make you do it?

724
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,814
Or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayflower?

725
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,108
Can't we just go back
to the kissing part?

726
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,988
What's going on in there?

727
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,532
You want me to rape them?

728
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,662
Here, just read your book,
Butterfinger.

729
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,879
"Not in a boat, not on a train."

730
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,965
Not with a goat, not in the rain.

731
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,135
- "I do not like green eggs and ham..."
- To yourself. To yourself!

732
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,929
It's more complicated
than that, Hudson.

733
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,640
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayflowers' peculiar interest...

734
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,100
in the three da Vinci pieces.

735
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,768
The Sforza statue was a fake...

736
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,480
but I was under orders
not to denounce it.

737
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,774
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

738
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,735
- You didn't know?
- No.

739
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,281
I'm just some guy
that's good at swiping stuff.

740
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,742
Who knew that would lead to this.

741
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,871
Christ, they even got
the CIA Involved now.

742
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,124
Here's looking at you, kid.

743
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,005
Hey. This doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

744
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,259
I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

745
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,807
Why didn't you say at the restaurant
that Hawk had hit the Vatican tonight?

746
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,601
My people will not be happy.

747
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,228
I want to see Kaplan.

748
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,156
Damn meddlesome
Vatican organization.

749
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,035
Hey! Way to go, Anna!

750
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,204
Hudson Hawk had
some interesting things to say...

751
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,373
about you and the Mayflowers.

752
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,209
Basically, that you're all part
of the same car pool.

753
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,755
Anna, Anna, Anna,
if that were so...

754
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,643
Almond Joy would've
handed you your heart...

755
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,051
right after you handed her
the Codex.

756
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,095
No, now the trip is this:

757
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,722
Soon as the Mayflowers find out
we have the Codex...

758
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,370
they're gonna want to make a deal.

759
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,060
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

760
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,063
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

761
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,066
I wouldn't worry too much
about him. He's...

762
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,193
He's gonna be in very good hands.

763
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,071
But you, you look really tired, kiddo.

764
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,279
Maybe you should go back
to Rome and get some sleep.

765
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:43,245
Kit Kat? Oh, there you are.

766
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,373
See that Miss Baragli
gets home safely.

767
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,085
Arrividerci, baby.

768
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,715
With all due respect
to that great dress...

769
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,592
how come you didn't you let me
cut her heart out?

770
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,012
Close call, close call.

771
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:05,183
But she's the only way we have keeping tabs
on the damn mysterious Vatican organization.

772
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,024
Bunny Mayflower.

773
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,964
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

774
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,654
It's been 1200 hours
since my last confession.

775
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,865
Hit me with your best shot.

776
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,950
I betrayed a man.

777
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,911
A good man. An innocent man.

778
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,288
A thief.

779
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,041
Anna, what are you trying to say?

780
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,127
Father, we've been
double-crossed by the CIA.

781
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,630
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

782
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,758
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

783
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,801
and a legitimate
government procedure...

784
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,887
but he knew right from wrong.

785
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,431
Oh, and we kind of messed around.

786
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,854
Messed around? Messed around?!

787
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,778
Seventeen Hail Marys
and five minutes outside.

788
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:02,658
So, Sister, what you are saying
is that Hudson Hawk...

789
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,077
is not willingly working
for the Mayflowers...

790
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:09,373
but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are?

791
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,667
I thought we were using the CIA
to get to Mayflower...

792
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,045
but the CIA is using me
to keep us away from Mayflower.

793
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,632
The pope warned me
never to trust the CIA.

794
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,968
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

795
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,596
the world economy will be ruined.

796
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,140
Ay-yi-yi.

797
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,101
Lord help us.

798
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:33,647
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

799
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,023
I'm going to find out.

800
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,608
But you must remember, Sister...

801
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,320
you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

802
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,699
Yes, Your Eminence.

803
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,200
Just say, "God go with me."

804
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,577
God go with you, Sister.

805
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:50,706
Ball!

806
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,214
Jolly good shot, sir.

807
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,552
Hudson Hawk.

808
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,846
You cease to amaze me, convict.

809
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,223
You are a terrible cat burglar.

810
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,475
Haven't you ever seen,
like, David Niven?

811
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,310
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

812
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,563
Like a cat, one would say.

813
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,108
I could take it back.

814
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,027
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

815
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,625
Oh, you two! There's nothing
I hate more than failure.

816
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,669
All you had to do
was follow the Hawk.

817
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,673
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

818
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,759
I suppose we're just going to
have to kill them.

819
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,601
God, Minerva, I was just joking.

820
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,951
- Get away from there, convict.
- Just browsing.

821
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,705
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

822
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,124
Oh, really?

823
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,876
Don't hurt him?

824
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,587
Even if he does this?

825
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,089
What about this?

826
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,135
Surely, this must offend!

827
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,098
Things are really heating up
at the Castle Vinci tonight!

828
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,892
Mamma mia, pizzeria!

829
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,101
May I call you Minnie?

830
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,313
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out.

831
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,232
Come to think of it,
there is a part of your body...

832
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,319
that you won't be needing
for your next job.

833
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,571
I always did wanna
sing like Frankie Valli.

834
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,283
Big boys don't cry.

835
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,331
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

836
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,877
Look, you Eddie Munster-looking
motherfucker...

837
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:04,246
somebody better tell me what's going on,
or I ain't gonna move another muscle.

838
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,758
- I wanna be treated like an adult.
- That's fair.

839
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,886
Now go to your room.

840
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,723
What?

841
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,107
So, Captain Hawk,
in one of your paws...

842
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,151
you've got a gold bar
worth about eight thou.

843
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,905
In the autre, you've got lead
that won't get you gelato.

844
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,325
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

845
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,661
That's one down. Kitty Carlisle.

846
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,204
Cool, isn't it?

847
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,208
Weight, feel, malleability.
They're all but identical.

848
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:44,170
On the periodic chart of elements
they're but one proton apart.

849
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:49,301
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

850
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,510
Alchemy?

851
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,179
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s, my man.

852
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:57,100
Minerva read it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.

853
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,687
I dumped some lire into research
and, shazam!

854
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,481
We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

855
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,735
detailing la macchina d'oro...

856
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,029
"The gold machine,"
for the hoes at home.

857
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,573
And the rest is
about to become history.

858
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,408
Money isn't everything.

859
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,160
Gold is.

860
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,411
Fuck T-bills!

861
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,913
Fuck blue-chip stocks!

862
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,289
Fuck junk bonds!

863
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,249
We've got the real deal.

864
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,251
Money will always be paper...

865
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,922
but gold will always be gold.

866
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,930
After a couple of years
of steady production...

867
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,730
we'll flood the market
with so much gold...

868
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,637
that gold itself,
the foundation of all finance...

869
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,263
will lose its meaning.

870
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,099
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

871
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:42,062
will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

872
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,271
Sounds like a party.

873
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,231
Markets will crash-crash.

874
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:48,360
Financial empires
will crumble-crumble.

875
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,487
Except yours-yours.

876
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,323
In 1992, baby...

877
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,158
the European superpowers
are coming together...

878
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,661
to form one business superpower.

879
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,914
And that's one party
we're gonna love to poop.

880
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,207
Well, that's set.

881
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,878
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

882
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,757
On display for three days only
at the Louvre, in Paris.

883
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,509
As opposed to the Louvre
in Wisconsin?

884
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,511
Shut up.
You'll make me lose my place.

885
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,179
You're gonna have
to go in at night.

886
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,598
- The security will be overwhelming.
- Twelve guards...

887
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,102
Okay, time out.

888
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,063
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

889
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,391
Put me in jail. Put me and...

890
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,899
Jail, you asshole?!

891
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,069
Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

892
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,904
Bunny? Ball-ball.

893
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,866
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

894
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:40,745
I'll kill your friends, your family
and the bitch you took to the prom.

895
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,498
Betty Jo Biarsky? I can get you
an address on that, if you want.

896
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,500
You have a dilemma, tiger.

897
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,962
And I think I know what's gonna
help you solve it.

898
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,802
I'll kill you all!

899
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,556
I swear to God. I'll kill that butler.
I'll kill that little yappy dog.

900
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,560
I'm sick of this!

901
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:11,818
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

902
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,154
"Keep off the grass"?

903
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,156
Let's play soccer.

904
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:19,200
The only law I cared for
was friendship.

905
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,704
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

906
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:28,710
I just don't think that it's such a smoking-hot
idea to leave them in there alone.

907
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,919
Relax, George.

908
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,922
That's why we hired the
pasta-slurping Guinea to begin with...

909
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,257
to keep Hawk in line.

910
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,510
This Gates-Mario brothers-
CIA-Mayflower-da Vinci thing...

911
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,723
I mean, it seemed like
a sweet deal.

912
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,933
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

913
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,436
I don't know, Eddie,
I thought you'd get into it.

914
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:51,399
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A.s at the bar.

915
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,319
But I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

916
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,364
Them using me to use you.

917
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:02,494
I'm sorry, Eddie...

918
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:06,039
but there's only
one way out of this...

919
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,918
and it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

920
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,049
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

921
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,510
You've got to love male bonding.

922
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,815
You fucked my freedom
for a lousy job?

923
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,278
Come on!

924
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,078
- You know something, Eddie?
- What?

925
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,789
- You hit like a girl!
- Oh, really?

926
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,166
I was only kidding.

927
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,510
Tommy! No!

928
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,595
Tommy!

929
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,696
Plan B, George.

930
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,450
Plan B?

931
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,106
No sweat, Tommy. You just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

932
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,525
Don't act like you never
committed a crime before.

933
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,819
- I know I made a bad call.
- What was your per diem?

934
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,031
- Thank God you're dead.
- It was so beautiful.

935
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,826
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

936
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,456
- Ketchup. You can't beat Heinz 57.
- Five-Tone.

937
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,583
- What?
- You fucked my freedom for a job?

938
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,377
- You don't understand.
- I said I was sorry.

939
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,338
You better be glad I don't hit women,
assuming you are a woman,

940
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,298
because from now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

941
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,758
- Hey, look, Eddie, I'm sorry.
- Hudson, I'm sorry.

942
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,552
I work for a covert Vatican
humanitarian organization...

943
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,387
and the CIA
made a fool out of me.

944
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,847
- What's more...
- Hey, man...

945
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,017
I care for you... I love you.

946
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,228
- Then what's this?
- Where did you get that?

947
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,771
The da Vinci castle.

948
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,482
You know, the place where you
gave the bad guys the Codex.

949
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,734
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

950
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,486
So they really were that
close to making it work.

951
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,574
But now that they lost the services
of the world's greatest cat burglar...

952
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,865
and his dead partner...

953
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,117
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

954
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,454
And we get to go home.

955
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,998
- Five-Tone, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

956
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,927
Why do they leave all these rocks
and shit laying out in the backyard?

957
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,544
They're called ruins, Eddie.

958
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,421
- Ruins?
- Yeah, ruins.

959
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,590
Good name.

960
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:12,225
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

961
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,769
I never saw a look on a face like this
when he got caught.

962
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,230
I swear to God,
he was so embarrassed.

963
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,440
You know,
speaking of being caught...

964
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,068
isn't the CIA gonna think
to check out this place?

965
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,861
No, they fell for the fake death.

966
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:26,656
They think Hawk's been arrested.

967
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,201
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
by my sources boarding a plane out of Rome.

968
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,120
- Hudson.
- Where to?

969
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,997
Five-Tone, will you quit
worrying about it, man.

970
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,749
I'm not worried, alright,
I'm just being cautious.

971
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,003
Okay, guys.
On that note, it's time for bed.

972
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,171
- I couldn't agree more.
- Okay.

973
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,011
Tommy, you're gonna sleep here.

974
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:51,306
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

975
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,682
Oh, yeah. Good night.

976
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,392
I'll get you some sheets.

977
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,477
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

978
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,693
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

979
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,778
- Is.
- Was.

980
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:08,072
There's some things
you don't know about me.

981
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,158
But there's some things
I do know about you...

982
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,203
and about me,
and about that bed.

983
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,706
This is not the time, Hudson.

984
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,960
Look, can't we just have
a late-night cappuccino?

985
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:25,173
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

986
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,678
- Yeah. I remember.
- Good night.

987
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,680
Good night.

988
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,647
Don't even think about it.

989
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,358
Don't say another word.

990
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,486
It's a very special night.

991
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,238
Very funny. Very funny, Tommy.

992
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,053
Good morning.

993
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,307
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

994
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,184
I'm losing respect for you guys.

995
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,146
You were that close
to getting away with this crap.

996
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,773
- Get up.
- Now, where's Anna?

997
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,525
You know, George,
it's nice of you guys to drop by...

998
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,027
but next time,
you might want to phone ahead.

999
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,756
Why don't you come back in a half-hour.

1000
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,448
Grab ourselves a shower,
pick up some croissants and shit.

1001
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:37,078
I really wish I could come up with this
glib repartee, the way you guys can.

1002
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,790
But I can't.
So I'll just paralyze you. A. J?

1003
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,168
Curare darts.

1004
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,837
When it comes
to instantaneous loss...

1005
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,880
of all physical control
below the neck...

1006
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,050
- I highly recommend them.
- Eddie, I can't move!

1007
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,594
I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

1008
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,222
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitches!

1009
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,684
Come here!
My head against yours.

1010
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,060
Fair fight!

1011
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,771
This is how I go out.
Like a hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

1012
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,857
Like a Gumby in the store?

1013
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,067
What the fuck are you la...?
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

1014
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,610
You made it come out of my nose.

1015
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,820
Keep that shit up!

1016
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,906
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

1017
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:16,534
The Louvre?

1018
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,831
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

1019
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,208
Or should I say this morning's?

1020
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,335
I admit we displayed
a lack of nuance.

1021
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,005
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

1022
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,133
Well, we weren't being judged
for neatness...

1023
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,051
only results.

1024
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,304
Goddamn it. Yanks lose again.

1025
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,057
- How did the Mets do?
- Can you turn to section B.

1026
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,980
You guys may be
the fairest cat burglars of them all...

1027
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,107
but if you weren't
such snobs...

1028
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,820
a lot of those guards at the Louvre
might still be alive.

1029
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,947
But that's irrelevant now.

1030
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,083
You're irrelevant now.

1031
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,169
Because tonight...

1032
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,838
at the Castle da Vinci...

1033
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,381
we make gold!

1034
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,550
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

1035
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,177
Ah, more babes for the party.

1036
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,803
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Anna.

1037
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:21,140
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

1038
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,059
Anna Baragli...

1039
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,520
Came to play!

1040
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,647
Anna-banana-fo-fanna.

1041
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,024
You're not gonna shoot
little old me, are you?

1042
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,109
You're not gonna
shoot little old anybody.

1043
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,111
- Pull the trigger. Shoot.
- Shoot, Anna.

1044
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,655
I read your dossier...

1045
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:38,199
- Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

1046
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,995
Why did she call you Sister?

1047
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,331
I'm sorry, Hudson,
I meant to tell you.

1048
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,917
- He didn't know.
- He didn't know!

1049
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,126
Know what?

1050
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,379
Hawk likes a nun!

1051
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,637
Those better be tears
you're crying, Tommy.

1052
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,472
They are.

1053
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,099
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

1054
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,060
Oh, no. You love me. It's your job!

1055
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,437
You probably love
Butterfingers over there.

1056
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,647
Well, yeah.

1057
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,984
In a weird sort of Catholic way, I do.

1058
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,236
But you...

1059
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,446
You...

1060
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,911
Well, Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

1061
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,123
- And as for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

1062
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,504
A souvenir.

1063
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,298
Ciao.

1064
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,011
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

1065
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:44,432
Guys, we got some good news
and some bad news.

1066
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,435
The good news is you'll be completely
unparalyzed in about two minutes.

1067
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,148
The bad news is that leaves you only
five seconds to defuse the bombs.

1068
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,858
- Bombs?
- Bombs?

1069
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,657
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

1070
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:04,285
I'll just shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

1071
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,916
Almond Joy! More paralysis!

1072
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,296
- You can move?
- Yeah.

1073
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,092
This is what I get
for darting a nun!

1074
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,763
Get this fucking thing off my head!

1075
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,267
- Tommy, look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a bad migraine.

1076
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,686
Maybe it was a dud.

1077
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,871
I don't know. It must be the curare.

1078
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,290
It's been known to have
certain side effects.

1079
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,126
Oh, really, George?

1080
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,130
I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

1081
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:01,717
Listen, Anna. The apprentice's diary
contains a code...

1082
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:06,180
that explains how the three
pieces of crystal fit together.

1083
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,932
If you could do us the honor...

1084
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,019
and decipher how the code works,
we would be eternally grateful.

1085
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,855
What does the color blue
taste like?

1086
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,191
Bobo knows.

1087
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,196
I must speak with the dolphins now.

1088
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,038
Just shoot her. Anybody?

1089
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,792
Darwin, this is supposed to
be torture, not therapy.

1090
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,346
- Eddie, the old man said turn left at the fork.
- He said turn right.

1091
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,090
If you wanna save Anna,

- What the hell are you talking about?

1096

- I got a plan.

- Go ahead.

Come on.

how you look?

or tenth or 11th or 12th rep.

No, you’ve gotta go through this
pain barrier, and just go on and on.

And it’s these last two,
three or four repetitions,

630
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:26,102
that’s what makes
the muscle grow,

631
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,771
and that’s what separates one from
being a champion and not being one.

632
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:31,625
This is what most people lack, the
guts to just go in there and say,

If I fall, I have no fear."

you when you’re dead.
