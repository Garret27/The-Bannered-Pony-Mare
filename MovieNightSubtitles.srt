1
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:24,061
Today we are going to pretend
to be trees.

2
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,648
We're gonna be tall, wonderful,
green trees

3
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,069
with really long branches
and lush leaves.

4
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,445
So, if you'll stand up for me.

5
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,911
What's that noise?
Can anybody hear it?

6
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,288
- Wind.
- Wind.

7
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,836
And then suddenly...

8
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,341
there's a storm.

9
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,476
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

10
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:04,643
- Hey.
- Hi.

11
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,788
How's the house hunting going?

12
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,648
Yeah, uh, it's okay, I mean,
it's just been going on and on.

13
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,567
Well, take my advice, pounce now.
Market's going through the roof.

14
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,903
Yeah, we're gonna drop and see
estate agents later, so...

15
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:15,279
Well, don't get left behind, Gemma.

16
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,739
Okay, bye.

17
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:35,091
Who did that to the poor baby birds?

18
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,467
I don't know.

19
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,303
Maybe it was a cuckoo.

20
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,680
Why?

21
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,474
Because it needed a nest.

22
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,103
Why doesn't it just make
its own nest?

23
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,441
Because that's nature,
that's just the way things are.

24
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,611
I don't like the way things are.
They're terrible.

25
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,947
Well...

26
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,366
- It's only horrible sometimes.
- Molly.

27
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,704
- Bye, Ms. Pierce.
- Bye.

28
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,219
Hey there, little lady.
Come a little closer.

29
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,803
Nah-ah!

30
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,807
Come on, Mr. Tree
wants to get to know you.

31
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:26,267
Ah, there you go. There you go.

32
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,521
My bark.

33
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,071
- Hey.
- Hi.

34
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,949
Mm. So, how am I at the tree game?

35
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,577
- Yeah, you're pretty mediocre.
- That's good.

36
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,872
Sad little things.

37
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,290
It's cruel.

38
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,671
Okay, there you go.

39
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,147
Hey, come on.
Show some respect.

40
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,234
- Did you knock them down?
- No, I did not knock them down.

41
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:17,818
I am a professional.
Come on. How dare you?

42
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,779
- Professional weirdo.
- Yeah, but professional.

43
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,281
Professional.

44
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,784
I'm gonna get
my own wheels one day.

45
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,411
Just you wait, I'm gonna have,
like, a big, you know,

46
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,662
muddy gardener's van.

47
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,665
- Sounds delightful.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you gonna change
your T-shirt?

49
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,710
- What?
- Your T-shirt.

50
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,357
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,005
- Shit.
- You stink.

52
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,114
Yo, seriously. Your mom,
she's the worst offender, too.

53
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,341
She's hardly over there.

54
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,365
She's there all the time.

55
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,908
Well, she came
with the apartment.

56
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,995
Yeah.

57
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,837
Hello.

58
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,422
We're just, um...

59
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,007
- looking...
- Yeah.

60
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,634
- ...for something...
- And you are?

61
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:27,096
I'm Gemma.
This is my boyfriend, Tom.

62
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,432
Hey, what's up?

63
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,728
Gemma and Tom,
lovely to meet you.

64
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,690
It's lovely to meet you too, Martin.

65
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,111
Yonder is a wonderful development.

66
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:47,158
Both tranquil and practical,
it has all you'd need and all you'd want.

67
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,533
And as for the prices,

68
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,662
it's no wonder these houses
are getting snapped up.

69
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,959
I know what you guys are thinking.

70
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,753
Suburbia.

71
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:03,423
But there's more to Yonder
than what you see in these images.

72
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,802
We've lovely people,
all sorts of people ready to move in.

73
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,389
It's going to be
a diverse community.

74
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,516
Something different, a nice blend.

75
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,977
Where's it located?

76
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,729
Near enough.

77
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,106
And far enough.

78
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,734
Just the right distance.

79
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,779
We could take a look, if you like.

80
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,697
- Hmm.
- Do you have a vehicle?

81
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,950
- Ah, shit. Unfortunately...
- Yes, we do, outside.

82
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,371
Good. I'll get my keys.
You can follow me.

83
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:41,044
We could arrange an appointment
at a later date, if you'd prefer.

84
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:45,257
But like I said, homes at Yonder
may not be available for much longer.

85
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,341
All right.

86
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:50,096
It's not exactly
what we're looking for, but, um...

87
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,974
- I suppose it's...
- Worth a look?

88
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,853
Good. We're all happy, then.

89
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,232
Jesus.

90
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,027
Martin, you are one strange
and persuasive motherfucker.

91
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,111
- Oh.
- Ready.

92
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,030
- Yeah, ready, yeah.
- Ready.

108
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,881
Let's get this over with.

109
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,591
Okay.

110
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,059
- Welcome to Yonder.
- Thank you.

111
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,062
Number nine.

112
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,957
Many homes have the pretense
of being ideal.

113
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,960
But these homes really are ideal.

114
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,380
Please go through.

115
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,052
Toasty.

116
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,055
- It's...
- Yeah.

117
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,139
Oh.

118
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,811
The living room. A room to live in.

119
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,441
Memories will be made in the ample spaces
between these walls.

120
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,945
Come.

121
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,882
It's good, it's good.

122
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,033
I love it. I love the single hue.

123
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,753
A welcome tipple.

124
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,006
- I'm... I'm driving.
- Mm.

125
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,594
- Perhaps a strawberry.
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm driving.

126
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,692
Blue for a boy.

127
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,028
You've got it all worked out.

128
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,157
Number nine
is not a starter home.

129
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,159
- This house is forever.
- Hmm.

130
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,828
A perfect environment
for a young family.

131
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,623
Do you have children?

132
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,333
No. Not yet.

133
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,418
No. Not yet.

134
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,682
- The master bedroom.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,062
If you follow me to the back garden.

136
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,564
A haven of nature.

137
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,791
It's good, it's nice here.

138
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,001
- Yeah.
- If you wanna...

139
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,671
live here, it's a lot of space.

140
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,140
So, when're people due to move in?

141
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,481
Huh?

142
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:55,734
Martin?

143
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,487
Martin?

144
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,706
- Hello?
- Nope.

145
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,341
- His car's gone.
- Huh?

146
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,884
His car's gone.

147
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,971
Good. Now, let's get the fuck out of here.

148
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,484
Okie dokes.

149
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,548
Buh-bye.

150
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,554
- That guy was so strange.
- Yeah.

151
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,391
Wait. No, no, I don't think
this is the right way.

152
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,063
- Yeah, this is the way we came in.
- No, is it?

153
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,397
Yeah.

154
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,612
Wait.

155
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,413
- What? You think it was back there?
- Yeah, I think it was back there.

156
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,215
Let me just see
what's around here, though.

157
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,299
Number nine again.
Did we just do some kind of loop?

158
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,134
What the fuck?

159
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,805
Wait, did we...
Did we leave the door open?

160
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,143
How've we just...

161
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,117
You want me to drive?

162
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,037
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah? You're good?

163
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,999
'Cause I think we're literally
going in a circle.

164
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,214
Tom.

165
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,426
All right.

166
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,428
- Give me the wheel.
- What?

167
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,889
What difference is that gonna make?

168
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,287
Okay. Come on. Give me a go.

169
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,601
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,498
- You wanna go on the car?
- Yeah.

171
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,313
- What are you? Six?
- Yeah, I'm six.

172
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,482
Come on, just move over.

173
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,485
Fine.

174
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,739
I'll give you a go.

175
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,658
A little go of the car.

176
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,638
Okay. Let's go.

177
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,634
- Do you have your phone?
- Yeah.

178
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,554
Anything?

179
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,515
No, there's no coverage on either of them.

180
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,268
Great.

181
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,321
- Tom.
- What?

182
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,990
Number fucking nine again.

183
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,537
- Hmm.
- Fuck this.

184
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,958
Ooh, you're not doing that in my car.

185
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,085
I'm opening the window.

186
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,546
You're such a jerk.

187
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,424
One second, I'm stressed.

188
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,892
Okay, let's go. Thank you.

189
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,152
Number nine.

190
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,737
Why the fuck do we keep seeing
number nine?

191
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,113
I haven't seen a single car.
There's nobody here.

192
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,490
<i>If I see another row
of green houses...</i>

193
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,991
<i>Okay, who the fuck
would live in this place?</i>

194
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,203
<i>- ...I'm gonna lose my mind.
- This shit is not possible, okay?</i>

195
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,579
<i>- It's not possible.
- We got in here...</i>

196
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,625
<i>Tom, we have gone this way.</i>

197
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,440
<i>- I have gone this way that's...
- All right, no, no, just...</i>

198
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,255
<i>- Just let me figure this out...
- ...where you took the wheel.</i>

199
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,967
<i>Please, can you just listen to me
once? I think we should take a left.</i>

200
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,885
- I know what I'm doing.
- You've done this, like,

201
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,553
- five or six times now.
- I know what I'm doing.

202
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,139
I know what I'm doing.

203
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,684
It just goes on
and on and on.

204
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,875
It's empty.

205
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,087
Oh, my God.

206
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,573
Hello?

207
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,414
Hello!

208
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,890
Let's go inside.

209
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,096
No taste.

210
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,948
I've never heard such silence.

211
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,743
Well...

212
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,296
Come here.

213
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,008
All right. Hold the base with your foot.

214
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,307
Be careful.

215
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,145
Okay.

216
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,714
Well, what do you see?

217
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,430
Tom, what do you see?

218
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,100
Hey, maybe...
Maybe we should follow the sun.

219
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,438
We'll... We'll cut through gardens,
we'll jump over fences,

220
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,983
what... Whatever it takes, all right?
We're... We're gonna get out of here.

221
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,979
Are you okay?

222
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,610
Yeah.

223
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,743
I... I've gotta stop.
I've gotta stop.

224
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,252
- Tom, there's a light.
- A light?

225
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:58,295
There's a light.

226
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,803
- Holy shit.
- Hello?

227
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,179
Hello.

228
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,101
Hello?

229
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,274
What's happening?

230
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,165
What the fuck?

231
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,675
Come back!

232
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,678
Come back!

233
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,558
Come back!

234
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,028
<i>Hey! Hey! Come back!</i>

235
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,097
- What have you done?
- I'm sending out a smoke signal.

236
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,846
Oh, my God.

237
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,326
Hi.

238
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,293
It's a boy.

239
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,339
Someone must be watching.

240
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,468
There must be
some way out of here,

241
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,157
everywhere has a way out.

242
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,600
<i>Yeah, well, maybe,
Gemma, if you didn't say no</i>

243
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,438
to every other goddamn house we looked at,
we wouldn't have ended up here.

244
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,608
So, I'm to blame?
How is this my fault, Tom?

245
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,944
I'm sorry, Gem, it's just this place
is making me crazy.

246
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,406
The food here
makes me feel sick.

247
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,459
Creepy little mutant.

248
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,087
Measure me.
Measure me, measure me.

249
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,062
Am I bigger today?

250
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,564
Yes. You're bigger today.

251
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:55,234
- I grow fast as a dog.
- That's right.

252
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,403
What is a dog?

253
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,948
We already told you what a dog is.

254
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,826
- Woof, woof, woof!
- Yes. Woof, woof, woof, woof.

255
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,887
Are you overwhelmed again, Mother?

256
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,556
I am not your mother.

257
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,684
Who is my mother?

258
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,394
God knows.

259
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,439
Dog knows. Dog knows.

260
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,095
Yum yum.

261
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,904
I don't know
why we do this.

262
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,282
They never seem to come when we're waiting
to bash their brains out with a pick.

263
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,953
- It's futile.
- Yeah.

264
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,582
Like putting an SOS on the roof
when planes never seem to pass, right?

265
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,627
Yep.

266
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,639
Watching.

267
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:35,436
That boy is always watching.

268
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,064
That's not a boy.

269
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,819
Coffee?

270
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,198
Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,825
This is just pointless,
it's just weird muck.

272
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,001
The box is gone.

273
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,894
Did you... Did you move the box?

274
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,396
- Tell me.
- Where're the roots?

275
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,981
- Tom.
- Where's the subsoil?

276
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,463
- Where's anything?
- It's gone. I was right here.

277
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,946
I was standing right here.
I was looking at the road.

278
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,114
Tom. Tom!

279
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,618
- Stop!
- Gemma, please! Just let me dig, okay?

280
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,829
This is something I can do.
Please just let me do this.

281
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,780
You were digging all day.

282
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:38,327
- All day, Tom.
- Yeah.

283
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,787
Why?

284
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,416
It's got to have a bottom.

285
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,044
It's gotta... It's gotta lead to somewhere.

286
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,130
- Where?
- I don't know.

287
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,719
Australia.

288
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,220
Yeah, baby.

289
00:34:57,221 --> 00:35:00,057
- Or hell.
- No.

290
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,559
No, we're already there.

291
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,844
All right, I'm gonna head back out.

292
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,639
Oh, well, wait for me, I'll come with you.

293
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,434
No, you know what?
We only got the... the one spade.

294
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,602
Well, I could use the pick.

295
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,814
You know, it kinda comes off
in clumps now. But, thanks.

296
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:06,636
There's like a smell in this car.

297
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:10,432
It's not bad, it's just like...
It's like a real smell.

298
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,393
- Have you noticed that? Yeah.
- Yeah.

299
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,772
I like it. I've just been...

300
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,607
breathing it in...

301
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,569
pretending that I'm home.

302
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,248
The battery's still good, Jesus.

00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,149
Tom, you okay?

328
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,986
Tom!

329
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,448
Are you all right?

330
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,206
Let me see.

331
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:44,169
Are you okay?

332
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,642
We can't be with you all the time.

333
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,062
People like to be alone
sometimes, okay?

334
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,483
Do you understand?

335
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,698
Not being with each other all the time.

336
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:19,163
Forget it.

337
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,131
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mother.

338
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,218
I'm not your mother.

339
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,020
What the fuck?

340
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,773
What do you want? We fed you.

341
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,026
What do you want?

342
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:53,197
Jesus! Say what you want.
What do you want?

343
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:56,075
Shut up. Shut up!

344
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,618
Shut up! Shut up!

345
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,021
Shut up!

346
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,747
Gemma, please,
just let me do this, okay?

347
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:05,918
This is something I can do. Just please,
Gemma, let me do this.

348
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,376
You're fucking disgusting.

349
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,422
- Please, Gemma, just please.
- Do you know that?

350
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:11,566
Just please let me do this.

351
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,675
- This is something I can do...
- You're fucking disgusting!

352
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,135
Please, Gemma, let me do...

353
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:17,364
Sorry.

354
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,500
It's okay.

355
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,875
I am fucking
disgusting, you know that?

356
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,211
I am fucking disgusting.

357
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,661
Are you gonna dig today?

358
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,456
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

359
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,335
Do you feel like you're making progress?

360
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:56,504
Yeah.

361
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,757
Yeah. So, I'm gonna, um...
I'm gonna get back to it.

362
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,051
Thanks.

363
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:06,449
- <i>What the fuck!
- Go to bed.</i>

364
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,744
- <i>Go to bed.
- Listen to me. Go to bed.</i>

365
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,494
<i>Listen to me, go to bed.</i>

366
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,913
<i>- Stop!
- Stop.</i>

367
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,280
Gemma.

368
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:48,575
No.

369
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,034
On.

370
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,703
- No.
- On!

371
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:52,913
No!

372
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:00,813
What am I supposed to do with him?

373
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,387
Whatever.

374
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,016
Whatever.

375
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,880
What are you doing?

376
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:46,006
Tom!

377
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,093
I'm locking it up.

378
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:50,219
I'm gonna starve it.

379
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,764
- Tom. Tom.
- Gemma, stay!

380
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:08,321
All right. Get in. Come on.

381
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:13,076
Give me the key.

382
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,661
- No, no. Get back in the house.
- Give me the key!

383
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:16,453
- Get back in the house!
- Tom. Tom!

384
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:20,292
- Gemma, come on.
- Tom, give me the key!

385
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,671
I am not looking after it, okay?

386
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,578
You will leave it there.
Don't play with it, don't feed it,

387
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:29,485
don't have anything to do with it.
You will let it starve.

388
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,114
- Let me up!
- Look, it has you acting

389
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:32,720
like you're its fucking mother, okay?

390
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:35,158
You're putting it to bed at night,
you're telling it not to watch cartoons.

391
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:37,601
Tom, let me up!

392
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,760
Look, I'm sorry, but I...
I will not let you help it.

393
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,701
Okay? If they don't want it to die,
they'll come for it.

394
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,081
It's up to them.

395
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:13,470
What if they don't come?

396
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:18,225
What are we supposed to do? Do we
just sit here and we wait for him to die?

397
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:21,602
- It.
- What?

398
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:23,855
It. Not him.

399
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:26,024
Stop saying him.

400
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,947
If it dies, maybe they'll let us go.

401
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,171
Hey.

402
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,715
Hey, it's okay.

403
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,301
He's not gonna hurt you, I promise.

404
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,429
You can come out.

405
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:03,645
I'm sorry.

406
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,856
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

407
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,858
<i>I can hear you.</i>

408
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:53,236
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

409
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,906
<i>I can hear you.</i>

410
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,180
He'll get tired soon.

411
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,454
And he'll go to sleep.

412
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,626
You should go to sleep, too.

413
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:08,960
Have a dream.

414
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:12,297
What's a dream?

415
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:16,051
It's, um...

416
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,390
It's like all sorts of moving pictures
in your mind,

417
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:24,684
but no one else can see them.

418
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:26,102
I've never had a dream.

419
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:28,438
Well...

420
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,816
close your eyes and try.

421
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,079
<i>Whoever's on the other side,
can you hear me?</i>

422
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,414
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

423
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:59,552
<i>Can you hear me?
I know you're out there.</i>

424
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:42,906
<i>What lovely sky we have.</i>

425
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,617
<i>It is lovely to live
under a lovely sky</i>

426
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,537
and a lovely house with
lovely houses all around us.

427
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,918
You are such a mystery.

428
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,507
You're a mystery
and I'm gonna solve you.

429
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:04,511
I'm a mystery. I'm a mystery.

430
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,266
Do you see that cloud?
What's that cloud in the shape of?

431
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,685
A cloud.

432
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:14,521
That's right.

433
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:17,941
Do you see that other cloud?

434
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,946
- Yes.
- What's that cloud in the shape of?

435
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,405
- A cloud.
- Yes.

436
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,575
Another cloud-shaped cloud.

437
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:30,119
All the clouds here
are shaped like clouds.

438
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:33,289
Perfect, sickening...

439
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:35,875
little clouds.

440
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,711
Do you like clouds?

441
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:40,922
Where I come from...

442
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:44,425
clouds come in all shapes and sizes,

443
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:46,865
some of them look like faces

444
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:49,305
and some of them look like dogs.

445
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,598
Woof, woof!

446
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:42,687
Did you see the boy?

447
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:45,773
No.

448
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,279
- He's gone missing.
- Well...

449
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,822
so have we.

450
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>Hello!</i>

451
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:14,427
Where are you?

452
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:38,366
Where did you go?

453
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,455
Where were you today?

454
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:09,458
I was solving a mystery.

455
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:11,251
Really?

456
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:13,754
- What did you discover?
- Lots.

457
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:19,634
- Lots? Like what?
- Lots and lots.

458
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,929
Did you meet anyone
when you were solving the mystery?

459
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,473
I met you when I was finished.

460
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,395
Did you meet anyone else?

461
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,440
Anyone you've never met before?

462
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:37,945
Who?

463
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,700
I'm not allowed to say.

464
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:00,968
Let's play a game.

465
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,512
Let's play pretend.

466
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,977
Pretend to be me.

467
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,981
Whatever.

468
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:17,944
Can you pretend to be Tom?

469
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,325
Gemma, stay!

470
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:29,080
- Will I do a dog?
- Yes, please.

471
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:36,087
Is there anyone else you can do?

472
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,592
Someone you met today?

473
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,971
Pretend to be that person.

474
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:17,878
Are you overwhelmed again, Mother?

475
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,549
I am not your mother!

476
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,927
Are you overwhelmed?

477
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:30,474
I want... to go home.

478
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,770
Silly Mother, you <i>are</i> home.

479
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,758
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

480
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:08,095
Do you mean that?

481
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:11,849
Or is that sarcasm?
Are you being sarcastic?

482
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,560
No.

483
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:18,397
But you don't really mean
that I'm welcome, right?

484
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:21,900
I was being polite.

485
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:24,028
Why are you being polite?

486
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,032
Is it fear?

487
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,744
Probably.

488
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:47,885
Probably.

489
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,054
You need to eat something.

490
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,850
I'll try.

491
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,158
Thank you.

492
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,124
What's wrong?

493
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,385
Why didn't I let you kill him
when he was young?

494
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:18,976
Because you're a...
you're a good person.

495
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:48,464
Thanks.

496
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:01,018
You like playing this game, don't you?

497
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,139
Tom!

498
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,621
Gemma.

499
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,170
<i>Tom!</i>

500
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,714
Gemma!

501
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,764
<i>Tom!</i>

502
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:10,184
Gemma!

503
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:14,021
<i>Gemma!</i>

504
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,233
Tom?

505
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:28,118
Gem...

506
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,621
Gem...

507
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:37,461
Tom.

508
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:40,547
Tom.

509
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:48,846
Tom.

510
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,808
Hi.

511
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:57,564
It's locked.

512
01:12:10,077 --> 01:12:12,496
Hey, open the door!

513
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:15,707
Let us in.

514
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:20,087
Open! Open the door!

515
01:12:20,088 --> 01:12:21,505
Open the door!

516
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,360
Tom.

517
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:47,531
Tom.

518
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,245
Tom.

519
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:55,581
Shit.

520
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,297
Please.

521
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:07,759
Please, please, please.
You need to help us,

522
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,720
'cause he's getting sicker and sicker.

523
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,639
Please, you can't leave him this way.

524
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:17,019
You know, maybe it's time
he was released.

525
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:45,148
Do you remember...

526
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:47,150
the wind...

527
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:48,527
Gemma?

528
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:51,530
Before we got here.

529
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,993
- Yeah.
- The wind was great.

530
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:00,497
I never realized how much I liked it.

531
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,395
I'm glad that guy stood you up.

532
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:27,774
You looked so glum.

533
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:32,779
I didn't know if it was okay
for me to go over and, like, talk to you.

534
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:36,908
You looked so glum, so cute.

535
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,786
I can't even remember what I said.

536
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:45,959
You didn't say anything, you just...
stood next to me.

537
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:48,086
Oh, shit.

538
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:50,505
That's creepy.

539
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:59,848
You told me I looked like
I needed a drink.

540
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:01,892
- You did.
- Mm-hmm.

541
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:05,645
- You said I looked like I needed one too.
- Mm.

542
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,025
And then I can't...

543
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:14,571
I can't remember
what happened after that.

544
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:18,158
- I guess we drank.
- Yeah.

545
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,788
We drank and... we drank.

546
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,419
Tom.

547
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:38,303
Tom... what happened then?

548
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:42,766
Then I...

549
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:46,644
I must have fallen over...

550
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:49,064
and woken up on... on your couch.

551
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:54,861
The sun was in my eyes,
I couldn't see anything.

552
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:57,823
I didn't know where I was.

553
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:04,955
You looked like you came out of the sun.

554
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:09,668
I could just see your silhouette.

555
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,547
And then when I...
I finally saw you...

556
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,925
I realized where I was.

557
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,595
And then you spoke to me.

558
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:24,057
What did I say?

559
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:31,731
You asked me if I wanted
some scrambled eggs.

560
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:36,610
And?

561
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,071
And that was that.

562
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,744
Yeah.

563
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,498
That was that.

564
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:57,132
I kinda felt like I was home...

565
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:03,305
because of you.

566
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:09,811
I'm... I'm home right now.

567
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:22,115
Tom?

568
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:25,535
Tom?

569
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,583
Tom?

570
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,381
Tom?

571
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,394
Tom?

572
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,588
<i>What am I?</i>

573
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,883
<i>What is this?</i>

574
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,804
<i>What am I in this?</i>

575
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,432
<i>You are a mother.</i>

576
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:30,269
<i>- A mother?
- Yes.</i>

577
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:33,272
<i>Someone who prepares her son
for the world.</i>

578
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:38,111
<i>What does a mother do then?</i>

579
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:42,115
<i>She dies.</i>

580
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:46,264
You go to sleep now.

581
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:48,162
Have a nice dream.

582
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:50,289
All we wanted...

583
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:55,336
- was a home.
- Silly Mother.

584
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:58,172
You are home.

585
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,431
I'm not your fucking mother.

586
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:08,433
Pardon?

587
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:12,060
I said...

588
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:15,940
I am not your fucking mother.

589
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,994
