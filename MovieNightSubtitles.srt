00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,287
Aha! You see?

182
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,663
You don't even think it's wrong.

183
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,500
Until you admit your sickness,
you will wear these.

184
00:13:55,584 --> 00:14:00,084
You will earn the right to wear civvies
once you have admitted the first step.

185
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,384
It's a long path to righteousness, Megan.

186
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,511
And it's a battlefield
of temptation out there,

187
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,513
and you're going to have to fight.

188
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:13,097
Until then, I'd like you to meet
one of our other soldiers.

189
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,561
Hilary?

190
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,523
Megan, this is Hilary.

191
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,025
She will show you around.

192
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,610
And, well, you'll get acquainted.

193
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,033
Okay. Rise and shine at 7:00.

194
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:31,869
Breakfast at 8:00.
Group therapy until lunch.

195
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,957
Now in the afternoon,
we have free time to do, um...

196
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,209
you know, whatever.

197
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:42,793
And then we move inside
for reorientating exercises.

198
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,174
Family therapy on the weekends.

199
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,470
Hmm. You didn't miss much, really.

200
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,602
Oh.

201
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,397
This is where we sleep.

202
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,318
But there's
no inappropriate behavior allowed.

203
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,947
Inappropriate? Like swearing?

204
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,240
No, inappropriate like fucking.

205
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,325
Oh.

206
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,870
You get caught in the throes
of sodomy, and <i>au revoir.</i>

207
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,840
Well, never mind Graham.
She's a spoiled brat.

208
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,593
I read her chart.

209
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,097
Step one was easy,

210
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,808
admitting you're a homosexual?

211
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,561
See? We all passed... yesterday.

212
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,235
I'm a homosexual.

213
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,780
See how easy it is?

214
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,835
Megan, meet the rest of our group.

215
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,171
Hi, Megan. Uh, I'm Jan,

216
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,967
and I'm a softball player,
and I'm a homosexual.

217
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,137
I'm Sinead.

218
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:16,182
I like pain, I'm a homosexual.

219
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,935
I'm Joel. I'm a Jew...

220
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,941
and a... homosexual.

221
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,238
- We met.
- Graham!

222
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,950
I'm Graham, and I like girls a lot.

223
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,494
And, uh, I'm a homosexual.

224
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,580
Andre. Actor, dancer, homosexual.

225
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,088
Dolph, homosexual varsity wrestler.
How you doin'?

226
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:52,176
I'm Clayton Dunn. I work in retail.

227
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,803
I'm a homosexual.

228
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,642
It's time for your first disclosure,
and don't be intimidated.

229
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:04,355
Why don't you start by telling us
about the first time

230
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,524
that you realized
that you might be a lesbian?

231
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,067
I'm not.

232
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,279
Everyone just thinks I am.

233
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,865
I shouldn't even be here.

234
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:22,206
That's a perfectly normal place to start.

235
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,709
Why don't we discuss the issues
in your intervention?

236
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,669
Well...

237
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,089
I'm a vegetarian.

238
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,465
Mm-hmm.

239
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,302
I have pictures of women around.

240
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,970
You think that's normal?

241
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,138
Sure.

242
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,975
I never really thought about it.

243
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,643
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

244
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:46,897
Yes, for two years
we've been going steady.

245
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,984
I really love him.

246
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,860
He's smart and popular.

247
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,737
And he's got the biggest dick
I've never seen.

248
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:58,325
Well, um... have you ever
had sex with him?

249
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,369
I'm a Christian.

250
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,829
It's really easy to be a prude

251
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,789
when you're not attracted
to him, isn't it?

252
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,500
He's very handsome.

253
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,044
But does he make you hot?

254
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,089
I mean, do you think
of him at night when you...

255
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:13,549
I'm not perverted!

256
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,135
I get good grades, I go to church...

257
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,095
I'm a cheerleader!

258
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm not like all of you.

259
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,434
Everyone reads Cosmo,

260
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:26,562
everyone looks at other girls
all the time.

261
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,607
But you only assume that they're thinking
what you're thinking when they look,

262
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,775
but they're not.

263
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,531
♪ <i>Freemont power,

264

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,372
I thought everybody had those thoughts.

267
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,377
I just want to be normal.

268
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,713
Then you admit you're not normal.

269
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:55,216
So why don't you admit
you're a homosexual?

270
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,600
You hug us way too much.

271
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,978
<i>Step one was easy.</i>

272
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,605
You don't even like to kiss me.

273
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,857
You put your hand up my skirt.

I'm a homosexual!

279
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,003
Congratulations, Megan.

280
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,297
You have just taken your first step

281
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,217
in your true direction.

282
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:43,931
I'm a homosex--

283
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,101
Okay.

284
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,520
- Go on now.
- Let's go. Bye, Megan.

285
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,194
Don't worry, Megan.

286
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,281
- It's going to be okay.
- No.

287
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,325
Here, put these on.

288
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,792
Oh, my God.

289
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,756
They were right.

290
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,925
I'm a homo.

291
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:24,305

Don't listen to her.

295
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,204
She's just upset
'cause the fish on her plate

296
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,039
is the only kind she can eat.

297
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:54,085
I can't wait to be straight.
I've always wanted to be.

298
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,837
It's cool to finally talk about it,
you know?

299
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,630
I mean, I can't tell
any of my friends on the team.

300
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,382
Maybe you have the wrong friends.

301
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,051
I think we should all
be supporting each other.

302
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,554
Really, princess? Do you want
to start the <i>Kumbayas?</i>

303
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,481
Hi, Mom.

304
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,900
- Flowers are pretty.
- I know.

305
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:23,823
You know, I noticed that we sprung
another leak in the ceiling.

306
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,408
I'd like you to get to it tonight.

307
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,452
I'll get to it, Mom. Jesus!

308
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:28,702
Ow!

309
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,038
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

310
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,248
Look, not in my presence.

311
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:36,832
I have told you over and over again,
no more sipping!

312
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,545
Chug it like a man!

313
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,714
Go on! Chug!

314
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,551
There.

315
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,429
Try and get to that tonight.

316
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:58,148
Ugh!

317
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,212
Yeah.

318
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,090
Mm.

319
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:26,093
- It's all right. It's just me.
- Oh, fuck.

320
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,178
What are you doing?

321
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,264
A.V. What's it to ya?

322
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,140
A.V.? What's that?

323
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,768
Aversion therapy, stupid.

324
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,687
So what does that mean?

325
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,190
When you have inappropriate
fantasies about girls,

326
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,192
you shock yourself with this shocker.

327
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,446
So every time you think of them,
you feel that pain.

328
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,906
That's sick!

329
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,366
No pain, no gain, baby.

330
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,785
If you want to like dick,
you better start training yourself.

331
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,788
Hey, isn't that Graham's sock?

332
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,957
None of your damn business.

333
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,516
Megan, you have a phone call.

334
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:17,770
- Hello?
<i>- Megan, it's Mom and Dad.</i>

335
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,857
<i>Oh, we know it's after lights out,
but we just miss you so much.</i>

336
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,360
<i>We just wanted to know
how our little poodle is doing.</i>

337
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,697
I'm doing okay. You were right.

338
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,783
I am a homosexual,
but I'll be regular soon.

339
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,494
<i>That Mary
is pretty good then, huh?</i>

340
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,621
Mm-hmm, and Mike
and all the others.

341
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,206
I'm already starting step two.

342
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,334
<i>We're so glad,
and after all that money.</i>

343
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,586
<i>Oh, we can't wait to see you
up there at graduation,</i>

344
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,630
<i>to have you home,
so we can all be together again.</i>

345
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,090
<i>Just remember, we love you.</i>

346
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,885
<i>We would do anything for our Megan
to have a normal life.</i>

347
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,970
<i>- And if you need anything--
- We'd better go.</i>

348
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,306
<i>Now you hang in there
and stay strong.</i>

349
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,474
- <i>Sweet dreams.</i>
- You, too, daddy.

350
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:57,810
See you at family therapy. I love you.

351
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,857
In step two, we'll begin the process

352
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,570
of everybody rediscovering
their gender identity.

353
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,115
Now, we all know
we're latent heterosexuals.

354
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,118
Now, what we must do is to relearn

355
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,996
our masculinity

I can follow the psychobabble.

This psychobabble, young lady,

364
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:45,774

to the gay lifestyle

00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:49,027
other than-than guzzling
a bottle of tranquilizers

366
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,738
or slashing your wrists.

367
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,117

Today we are going to learn

one of the most wonderful things
about being a heterosexual.

A mother. Women have roles.

And I realized that when we finished
swimming lessons,

466
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,712
we would change in front of each other.

we used to touch each other's legs
and rub up against each other.

Blowing each other
after your fucking bar mitzvah

Okay, go with that.

498
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:13,532
You know, we've kinda been like this
greeting card family.

499
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,871

where Dad was unemployed

500

00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,584
Wait a minute,
that was only for nine months.

502
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,961
And then I was offered
a much better job at the plant.

503
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:31,466
Well, it was maybe seeing Mom
kind of being the dad. Maybe I--

504
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,638
Maybe I got kinda the wrong idea
about the roles of men and women?

Not exactly.
