I'm...

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,011
Come on!

17
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,665
Fuck!

18
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,755
You missed the garbage.

19
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,829
You missed the garbage.

20
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,063
Put the phone down.

21
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,413
We don't want any trouble.

22
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,459
Your money. Cash.

23
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,982
Now!

24
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:50,899
Th-That's about all there is,
on that.

25
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,815
That-that's it?

26
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,557
I use a debit card.

27
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,385
Jesus.

28
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,084
I didn't find anything.

29
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,433
What about his watch?

30
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:05,957
Is this worth something?

31
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,481
To me, it is.

32
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,005
Take it.

33
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,186
Give me your ring.

34
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,796
Give me your fucking ring!

35
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,538
Hey!

36
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,541
Hey! Hey, get off him! Now!

37
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,631
Get off him! Get off him!

38
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,590
I swear to God,
I'll fucking shoot you!

39
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:30,852
Dad!

40
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,857
Now!

41
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,120
Let him go, son.

42
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,515
What?

43
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,604
I said let him go.

44
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,480
- Hey!
- What? What?

45
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,221
Please stop.

46
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,876
Just take what you want and go.
Please just...

47
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,007
Just shut up!

48
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,444
Let's get out of here.

49
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,273
Baby, let's go.

50
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,667
We picked the wrong
fucking house.

51
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,105
- Just... fucking shit!
- Shut up.

52
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,248
What the fuck, Dad?

53
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,092
I can't believe
I let this happen.

54
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,051
My beautiful wife,

55
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:43,141
beautiful kids, my home,

56
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,317
broken into with a freaking...

57
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,711
- Mr. Mansell.
- Excuse me?

58
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:49,931
So, that's how they got in, huh?

59
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,020
Using a pizza box?

60
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,630
Yeah.

61
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,371
And the golf club?

62
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,025
Did you even take a swing?

63
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,330
She had a, uh...

64
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,463
Could've taken her, Dad.

65
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,423
Look, you did the right thing,
Mr. Mansell.

66
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,908
You know, if that was
my family...

67
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:16,131
We're gonna get out
of your hair.

68
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:19,656
You just leave that
garage door closed, okay?

69
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,285
Hey, Dad.

70
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,678
Hey, kiddo.

71
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,245
- You couldn't sleep?
- No.

72
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,464
Well...

73
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,379
Oh.

74
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,557
You scared?

75
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,778
Why would I be?
You're here.

76
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,041
Yeah.

77
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,089
Dad?

78
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,264
Yeah?

79
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,397
We need a cat.

80
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,924
Yeah.

82
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,840
I was thinking the same thing.

83
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,290
Come on!

84
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,163
Fuck!

85
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,739
So, uh, I have to do a report
on a veteran for history class.

86
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,741
Think I could just
interview you?

87
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,179
Yeah, sure, son. Um...

88
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:34,617
you know, I was an auditor,
so kind of a nobody.

89
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,228
That makes for
a pretty dry story.

90
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,622
Yeah, I-I really don't...
don't care.

91
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,426
Just want to finish up
the project and call it a day.

92
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,017
What about your uncle Charlie?

93
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,584
He was a real soldier.

94
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,195
I didn't mean it.

95
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,023
Oh, your mom's right.

96
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,677
Hey, you know what, uh,

97
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,330
I actually already
left him a message.

98
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,681
I'll try again later.

99
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,552
Could try Grandpa.

100
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,815
He actually saw some action.

101
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,904
Yeah, maybe.

102
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,342
Have a great day.

103
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,083
Oh, and, um...

104
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,085
you missed the garbage.

105
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:13,134
I just...

106
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,055
Oh, I took all the coffee.

107
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,974
Have a good day, Hutch.

108
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,715
Yeah, you, too.

109
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,194
All right, kids, let's go.
Come on.

110
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,109
Let's go.

111
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,570
Put on your seat belt, okay?

112
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,442
Hold on.

113
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,709
Hey.

114
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,190
Heard you had some excitement
last night.

115
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,844
Yeah, it was just, uh...

116
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,847
Man, I wish they'd have picked
my place, you know?

117
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,719
Could've used the exercise.

118
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,244
That's new.

119
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,855
Pretty cool, huh?

120
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,639
Yeah, the old man croaked.

121
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,119
He didn't have much to leave,

122
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,773
but at least I got
something out of it.

123
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,209
Honey, come on.

124
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,472
Got to go.

125
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,779
I'm sorry for your loss.

126
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,346
There's nothing there
to mourn, man.

127
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,087
Pretty slick, though, huh?

128
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:40,525
The '72 Challenger,
4.9-liter V-8.

129
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:45,182
Zero to 60 in...
I'm about to find the fuck out.

130
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,837
♪ You're a heartbreaker...

131
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,539
♪ You're a heartbreaker...

132
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,382
What do we got?
A rat or a possum?

133
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,167
Don't know.

134
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,958
So...

135
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,655
Good morning, Charlie.

136
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,527
Did I hear right?

137
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,877
Depends who you talked to.

138
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:31,141
Well, your boy called.

139
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,361
Then, yeah, you heard right.

140
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:39,497
Now, he says that you had
the drop on one of them.

141
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,935
Why didn't you take 'em out?

142
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,632
I mean, shit...

143
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,416
it's child's play.

144
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,158
I was just trying to keep damage
to a minimum.

145
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,899
Oh, yeah?
How's that working out for you?

146
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,206
Everybody's safe, so...
Jesus!

147
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,991
Don't worry.

148
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,124
Safety's on.

149
00:12:58,647 --> 00:12:59,866
No, wait.

150
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,303
Oops. There.

151
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,392
There. See?

152
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:07,830
Now, there's nothing that
turns out the lights right quick

153
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,615
like a fucking bullet
to the brain, man.

154
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,270
So... take it.

155
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,272
I don't want it.

156
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,623
It ain't a matter of want,
Hutch.

157
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,451
It's the principle of need.

158
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:24,586
So, keep my sister safe, bro.

159
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,099
Hey.

160
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,536
Oh, hey.

161
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,799
Uh, I take it Becca called you.

162
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,932
She did.

163
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,630
And I'm thinking you did
the best thing you could.

164
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,068
I mean, you being you.

165
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,896
Yeah. I got you.

166
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,943
Look, let's talk about you
wanting to buy this place.

167
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,467
Do you really want to get rid
of me and Charlie that bad?

168
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,903
Eddie, you're family.

169
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,731
I just want you to enjoy
your retirement

170
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,951
and Charlie his youth.

171
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,214
It's a fair offer.

172
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:30,173
But not a great one, you know.

173
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,046
Look, I built this place up
from nothing with my hands.

174
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,354
If I'm going to sell it,
then I want it to be a...

175
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,269
goddamn great offer.

176
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,923
- You know?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,752
What do you want
with this place, anyway?

178
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,669
Guess I just want something
that's mine, you know?

179
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,715
I do.

180
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,763
Hey, Hutch.

181
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,548
I'm rooting for you.

182
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,956
Sounded good.

183
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,132
How long you been listening?

184
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,874
Long enough to know you're
getting mighty good at that.

185
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,051
Shit.
When you're officially dead,

186
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,705
got a lot of free time
on your hands, you know?

187
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,577
Rough life.

188
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,318
So, tell me about last night.

189
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,669
Word travels fast, huh?

190
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:18,194
Look,
if they know, I know, you know?

191
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,545
There were two of them.

192
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,895
A man and a woman.

193
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,724
Uh, late 20s, I'd say.

194
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,816
They were scared.

195
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,514
Desperate.

196
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,559
She had a gun.

197
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,518
What kind?

198
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:40,086
Uh, it was an old .38 Special.

199
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,003
Had electrical tape
on the handle.

200
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,657
It was a Smith & Wesson.

201
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,008
Hadn't been shot
in a long while.

202
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,228
And it was, uh...

203
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,756
...empty.

204
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,803
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

205
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:05,676
Hmm. Now I know why you
didn't do what you didn't do.

206
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,376
What'd they get?

207
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,509
Not much. Just a couple bucks.

208
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,512
Well, I guess it
could've been worse, man.

209
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,427
Yeah.

210
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,300
Look, I know what
you're thinking about,

211
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,389
and I wish you wasn't.

212
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,609
Don't do nothing stupid.
You hear me?

213
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:47,370
Hey, Dad.

214
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,025
- You been eating?
- What?

215
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,209
You okay?

216
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,866
I'm okay.

217
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
You don't look okay.

218
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,401
Do you remember who
we used to be, Hutchie?

219
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,750
I do.

220
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,247
Hey, buddy.

221
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,466
How was school?

222
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,684
Fine.

223
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,512
Hi, sweetheart.

224
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,819
Come on. Help out.

225
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,734
How was today?

226
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,302
- It was what it was.
- I can't find it.

227
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,304
- Ugh.
- You can't find what?

228
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,088
My kitty cat bracelet.

229
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,481
Where was it?

230
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,181
In here.

231
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:03,185
They couldn't have stolen that,
would they?

232
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
Honey, I'm sure
it'll turn up somewhere.

233
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,054
Back so soon?

234
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,012
Hey, Pop.

235
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,931
There's this thing I got to do.

236
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,586

- That's old.
- I'm looking for...

255
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,280
What?

256
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,762
Your I.D... the badge expired
by about 20 years.

257
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:28,461
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that ain't you in the photo.

258
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:29,984
So...

259
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,596
Who are you?

260
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,907
I'm just a man...

261
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,996
who's looking for someone.

262
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,998
Yeah, well,
you probably shouldn't

263
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,261
flash cheese like that
around here, bro.

264
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:51,353
There are three types of people
who, as you say, "flash cheese":

265
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,963
people who don't know
any better,

266
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,922
people who are seeking
to intimidate,

267
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,751
and people like me, who wish
with every fiber of their being

268
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,883
that someone would try
to take it from them.

269
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,326
Uh...

270
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,634
Thank you for your service.

271
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,465
You, too, old-timer.

272
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,916
So, any takers?

273
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,662
How can I help you?

274
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:43,449
Send me in the direction
of this person.

275
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Luis, dinner!

276
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:21,861
Luis.

277
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,490
Smells rich, my love.

278
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,514
Smells cheap.

279
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,580
It's not the food, it's the company.

280
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,830
I speak. You listen.

281
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,170
You know why I'm here.

282
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,824
'Cause I'm a good man.

283
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,435
I'm a family man.

284
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,064
Most of all, I'm a man
who did not deserve

285
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,526
your gun in his face.

286
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,441
Now, the watch.

287
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,144
The kitty cat bracelet.

288
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,495
What? I don't know
what the fuck you're...

289
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,672
Give me the goddamn kitty cat
bracelet, motherfucker!

290
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,282
I don't know what
you're talking about.

291
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,893
I swear to God, I don't know.

292
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,653
- The goddamn bracelet.
- I'll help you find it!

293
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please, man.

294
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,759
I don't know where it is!
Swear to God, I don't know.

295
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,347
Luis!

296
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,001
Hey, please just leave.

297
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,084
- Please don't hurt us. Please.
- Please just leave.

298
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,485
Fuck.

God doesn't close one door

303
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:53,639

304
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:59,601

361
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,454

00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:43,195
About what?

363
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,807

364
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,418
Becca.

365
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:57,644
How we haven't embraced
in far too long.

366
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:02,083
We haven't shared a kiss in...
I don't know.

367
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:05,913
We haven't had sex in months.

368
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:10,570
We haven't made love in years.

369
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,791
You seem so far away.

370
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:21,189
I know that's... it's unfair
to put it like that, but...

371
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,757
I just...

372
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,064
I-I miss you.

373
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,686
Remember who we used to be?

374
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,995
I do.

375
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,303
You passed it, motherfucker.

376
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,170
All right, man, there he is!

377
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,521
Hi.

378
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,584
On the house, sir.

379
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,088
Ah.

380
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,100
So, gentlemen.

381
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,899
Is the security for the
Obshak to your liking?

382
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,988
We are satisfied.

383
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,449
Yet your operation has its oddities.

384
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,910
Why is this black guy on your crew?

385
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,578
Choose your words wisely,

386
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,155
or I'll feed them back to you.

387
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,463
His shading may not match ours,

388
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,300
but Pavel is as Russian as we are.

389
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,757
Moscow Olympics, 1980.

390
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,761
My father was Ethiopian.
A long distance runner.

391
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,974
How'd he do?

392
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,270
Who cares?

393
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,222
He left my mom and
me to fend for ourselves.

394
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,931
Which he has done quite well.

395
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,650
Enough about Othello here.

396
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,154
Yulian,

397
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,021
Your singing and dancing...

398
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,106
are a little inappropriate for a guy...

399
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,283
who's protecting a shit ton of our cash.

400
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,412
It doesn't inspire confidence, you dig?

401
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,654
Feel confident now?

402
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,105
Yulian, I was just...

403
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:33,835
Do you know who that is?

404
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,455
Or was?

405
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,125
Enlighten me.

406
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,871
A three percent stakeholder in the Obshak.

407
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,540
Such a shame.

408
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,259
Therefore...

409
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,433
His equity is now ours.

410
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,820
Cheers!

411
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,431
Yes?

412
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,111
Oh little brother...

413
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
Will he walk again?

414
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,461
Sir, we are
monitoring his vitals,

415
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,638
but the damage
to his brain is...

416
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,005
Teddy's fucked?

417
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,458
Real fucked.

418
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,171
What the fuck was he doing on a bus?

419
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,390
No idea.

420
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,056
Think this has to do with the Obshak?

421
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,974
Everything has to do with the Obshak?

422
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,808
How much longer are we babysitting it?

423
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,230
A couple of days.

424
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,555
An eternity.

425
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:46,139
Dr. Mendez to Critical Care.

426
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,445
Dr. Mendez.

427
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,886
Yulian...

428
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,150
Who did this to my brother?

429
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,804
There was a man.

430
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,501
He attacked us unprovoked.

431
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:02,895
One man?
Are you fucking with me?

432
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,525
- No, sir. No, sir!
- Don't you lie to me!

433
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,508
Don't you fucking lie to me!

434
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,336
Don't you...

435
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,338
Don't you lie to me!

436
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,296
Don't you fucking lie to me!

437
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,081
I'm not lying to you. I swear.

438
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,346
Yulian?

439
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:21,870
Please don't get more mad.

440
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,484
You hated Teddy.

441
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:34,535
Your words may be correct,

442
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,885
but they are no less unwise.

443
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,120
What can you do?

444
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,414
You don't choose family.

445
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,534
No, you don't.

446
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,249
How can I find this man?

447
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,147
- Mmm.
- Morning.

448
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:24,150
Morning.

449
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,934
What happened to you?

450
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,588
Hmm?

451
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,372
Dad, you look like shit.

452
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,723
You should see the other guys.

453
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:33,681
When you made that tackle,

454
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,641
that was a good takedown.

455
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:39,252
You had my back,
and I'm proud of you.

456
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,428
Morning.

457
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,386
Morning.

458
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,826
Hutch here.

459
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:51,090
Last night, that was you, huh?

460
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,614
I thought we said no landlines.

461
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:56,138
Relax. I got 30 seconds.

462
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,618
Okay, well, go.

463
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:01,056
So, how did it feel?

464
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,058
Like salvation day.

465
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,278
Yeah, I bet.

466
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:08,629
Look, I'm happy that your
relapse made you feel so good,

467
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,240
-but, man, you got
a fucking problem. -Yeah?

468
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:14,504
One of those guys was the
brother of Yulian Kuznetsov,

469
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:16,419
and you don't want
to fuck with him, Hutch.

470
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:18,900
I'm serious.
Ask The Barber. He knows.

471
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:21,033
It was an isolated incident,
sir.

472
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:22,861
Yulian Kuznetsov.
Ask The Barber.

473
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:24,645
Who was that?

474
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,386
Just a distributor of ours.

475
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,083
Hey, I have an idea.

476
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,346
How about I make that lasagna
that you love tonight?

477
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,653
You know, from scratch,
like I used to.

478
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,742
- It's been a while.
- Lasagna!

479
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:36,875
I'd really like that.

480
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:01,551
♪ I told myself a lie

481
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,468
♪ When I said

482
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:09,211
♪ I had no cares

483
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:13,738
♪ 'Cause when I'm alone

484
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,478
♪ All alone

485
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,264
♪ Out come the tears...

486
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,700
Gentlemen.

487
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:22,877
Mr. Mansell.

488
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:25,445
It has been some time.

489
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,274
That it has.

490
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:31,973
What, pray tell,
may we do for you, good sir?

491
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:35,934
What can you tell me
about Yulian Kuznetsov?

492
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,769
Am I really now
that predictable?

493
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,989
From where I sit, Mr. Mansell,

494
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,426
everyone is.

495
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,517
Short story long,
he's as bad as they come.

496
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:58,608
A connected, funded sociopath

497
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:01,437
with resources
to make things complicated.

498
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,481
I don't want any fucking surprises.

499
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,138
So, he's a bad guy?

500
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,668
- Has he got any hobbies?
- Collects art,

501
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,018
to the tune of eight
and nine figures.

502
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:19,368
Anything good?

503
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,543
Fuck if I know.

504
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,415
But what I do know is,

505
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,504
if he doesn't know
who you are yet,

506
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:25,766
he will soon.

507
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,856
What have you got for me?

508
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,076
I found his dad.

509
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,252
He's got him at
a nursing home downtown.

510
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,558
That's not much.

511
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,473
I wouldn't worry
about this Hutch guy.

512
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:40,259
Your man here looks to be
as vanilla as they come.

513
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:45,525
If you can't recognize a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

514
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:49,659
I question the viability
of your employment here.

515
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:52,488
I have a friend at the Pentagon.

516
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,055
I'll keep looking.

517
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:57,929
One blackmail package coming up.

518
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,504
What the fuck?

519
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,162
What?

520
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:15,337
And if he can't take care

521
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:16,904
of a loose end like you,

522
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,255
he'd have to give up
his share of the Obshak.

523
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,302
The Obshak?

524
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,219
Think of it like the 401

525
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:29,656
of the Russian mob.

526
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:31,963
That's hundreds of millions
of dollars in cash

527
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:33,965
perpetually on the move,

528
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:37,490
and Yulian is
the current babysitter.

529
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,536
That said, he's more than
a bit weary of this life.

530
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,800
I think, if he had his way,
he'd probably walk away.

531
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:45,934
Goddamn Obshak.

532
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,746
I'm out. No need to pay.

533
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,661
Good luck.

534
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,419
Fuck me.

535
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,759
I want him alive.

536
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,110
It's beautiful.

537
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:33,938
May I interest you in some wine?

538
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:35,417
Yes, please.

539
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:37,071
Uh, I am also interested.

540
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:38,464
- Nope.
- Nope.

541
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:40,988
Um, who wants some?

542
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:42,555
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Me.

543
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:44,252
Right. There you go.

544
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:47,560
Hey, how about we all head
to Italy this summer?

545
00:47:47,603 --> 00:47:49,997
We've always talked
about going back.

546
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,825
Oh, I'd love that.

547
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,349
But, um, can we afford it?

548
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:57,439
I guess the real question is:
Can we afford not to?

549
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:00,616
- Well, that would be wonderful.
- Yeah.

550
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,663

from a U.S. military base
in Rivolto, Italy,

642

and his prize was me
looming over him

00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:52,180

I heard a man who
genuinely regretted his choices

651
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:04,845

than to shed his wolf skin

654

I went back to check on him,

back unto the fold.

657
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:24,778

00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:27,651

660
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,000

661
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,871

Nothing there to skim.

663
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:34,048

664
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:35,789

I wanted what Alan had.

668
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:51,326
So I told my bosses
I was out of the game.

669
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,546
They were not happy to hear it.

670
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:57,115

01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,276
But what am I gonna do?

733
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,974
I don't give a shit.

734
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,500
Deal.

735
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:59,939
Now get out of here.

736
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:02,246
Three unidentified
bodies were found dead

737
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:05,292
in a suspicious car accident
last night on Route 34.

738
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,512
Authorities are still trying
to figure out the cause

739
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:09,557
and if anyone else is involved.

740
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,820
If you have any information
on this accident,

741
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:13,300
you are encouraged
to call the...

742
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,289
Yulian, the old man killed
our guys and disappeared.

743
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,707
What do you want to do?

744
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,793
Get me every man we have.

745
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:12,011
Yo, Hutch, you there?

746
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:13,926
- Hutchie boy.
- Hey.

747
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,102
Dude, fucking with the Russians?

748
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:17,495
Classic, Hutch.

749
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:19,845
Fucking with that
batshit crazy Yulian?

750
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:21,431
I mean, that's a whole other
level of recklessness, man.

751
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:23,196
I got to do what I got to do.

752
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,261
Yeah, of course, right, right,
and get yourself shot.

753
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,895
That's going to solve
everything.

754
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:28,897
They came after my family.

755
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:30,682
- They came at Dad.
- I know.

756
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,163
Who the fuck you think
helped Pop clean this shit up?

757
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:34,729
I've got a plan.

758
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,383
You got a fucking plan.
Listen, Hutch.

759
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:38,547

Hey.

792
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,159
Enjoying the meal?

793
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:27,424
Oh. I came for the show.

794
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,860
Cute.

795
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:40,437
You have some nerve
to be here like this.

796
01:09:41,612 --> 01:09:44,223
Yeah. Maybe.

797
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:01,675
What say you and
I have a moment?

798
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,510
Everybody out.

799
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:29,312
Now, on the one hand,

800
01:10:29,355 --> 01:10:32,880
there's a long-dormant
piece of me now awake

801
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:36,406
that wants so very badly
to play this out.

802
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:39,670
The other,
more reasonable piece of me...

803
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:41,585
What's left of it...

804
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:43,717
Would like to end our little
tête-à-tête right now.

805
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,545
What's done is done.

806
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:47,721
After all,
we can both rebuild, right?

807
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:49,941
Right.

808
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:52,726
Mm, wait. Rebuild?

809
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,555
I burned it... all of it.

810
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,731
What all?

811
01:10:57,775 --> 01:10:59,429
Everything you have.

812
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:01,300
Had.

813
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,389
Everything you had.

814
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:06,610
My art?

815
01:11:09,352 --> 01:11:10,875
Obshak!

816
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:12,442
You should've seen it go up.

817
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:14,748
It was something.

818
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,490
I mean, if this doesn't
make us even...

819
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:19,840
Because, after all,
you came to my house,

820
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:24,541
which you know
you don't fucking do!

821
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,894
You killed my brother.

822
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:32,375
The last I saw,
he was still breathing.

823
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:34,812
And based on what little
I know of the man,

824
01:11:34,855 --> 01:11:37,249
that's probably more
than he deserved.

825
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,301
Now...

826
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,738
you can come after me,

827
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:49,914
and if you succeed
in taking me down,

828
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:55,136
well, you're still obligated
to refinance the entire Obshak,

829
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,138
which begs the question...
Can you?

830
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,879
Do you even want to?

831
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:01,752
'Cause I've heard
that you want out.

832
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:07,584
What better time than right now?

833
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:09,716
Let's both quit.

834
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,718
Right? You got a nest egg.

835
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:14,417
I mean, besides from what's
still smoldering.

836
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,027
So, hmm?

837
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,811
Get some work done.

838
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:20,161
Maybe, uh, open a tiki bar

839
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:22,903
in one of the lesser-known
Caribbean islands

840
01:12:22,947 --> 01:12:26,733
and live your life
far from me and mine.

841
01:12:33,174 --> 01:12:34,959
Think it over.

842
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:37,048
I'll be nearby.

843
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600

but to burn it all down?

916
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:24,705
- I got emotional.
- No.

917
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:27,230
No, you got stupid, Mr. Mansell.

918
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:30,711
And your family
will pay the price.

919
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:36,717
What's he doing?

920
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,764
What the fuck you doing, man?

921
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,636
Everybody dies.

922
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,771
Some sooner than others.

923
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,115
Okay, Hutchie.

924
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:39,955
Just a bit excessive...

925
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,174
but glorious.

926
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:44,960
Glorious, my ass.

927
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:48,050
Thank you. Thank you.

928
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,535
Well, that don't sound too good.

929
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:56,972
Yeah. Get out of here.

930
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:58,364
All right? I got this.

931
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:00,149
Yeah.

932
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:03,326
Well, Hutchie, you both got
what you wanted.

933
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:05,415
And I got shot.

934
01:23:27,654 --> 01:23:29,439
Hi. This is Rebecca Mansell.

935
01:23:29,482 --> 01:23:30,962

937
01:23:37,316 --> 01:23:40,667
Becca, it's me. I, uh...

938
01:23:40,711 --> 01:23:45,063
I owe you everything.

939
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,152
My life before you was...

940
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,068
Well, you know.

941
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:56,379
Thanks for letting me pretend
I was someone else.

942
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:59,077
If you give me another chance,

943
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:02,167

this time.

I'm nobody.

949
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:26,235
- Mm.
- That ain't much of an answer.

950
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:30,674
Trust me, it's answer enough.

951
01:24:30,717 --> 01:24:32,197
