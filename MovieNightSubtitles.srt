Randy.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
What's up, Mike?

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,801
-Who's your friend?
-Nobody.

26
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:58,512
Student ride-along.
Not a real person.

27
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,514
Man, don't take
that shit from them.

28
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,391
Hey. What y'all
doin' here anyway?

29
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:03,850
We got a disturbing
the peace call.

30
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:04,893
What?

31
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:06,853
Taggert, what the fuck
you talkin' 'bout?

32
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:08,480
They told us it was
an unknown medical.

33
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:09,940
Shit, I hope it is.

34
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,275
Somebody gotta go
to the hospital,

35
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,068
that's yo' paperwork, not mine.

36
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,569
Yep, the ABCs of police work.

37
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,238
"Ambulance before cruiser."

38
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,073
Please be "disturbing
the peace."

39
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:20,409
Please "disturbing
the peace." Come on!

40
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:21,576
Police!

41
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,789
OD.

42
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:27,457
That's on y'all, suck as.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,585
Shit.

44
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:32,587
-You wanna get the stretcher?
-Gladly.

45
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,464
Is she dead?

46
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,883
She's not dead.
Dying, but not dead.

47
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:38,718
What do we assess first?

48
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:41,596
-ABCs.
-ABCs. Um...

49
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:44,683
-Airway, breathing, circulation.
-Yes.

50
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,184
First thing, that's
what we check.

51
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,269
-Understand that?
-Yes.

52
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:49,229
-ABCs. They didn't...
-ABCs...

53
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,480
Oh, man.

54
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:53,191
Oh, oh, oh! Hey!

55
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,194
Know what the treatment is for
a dirty needle stick? Chemo.

56
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,738
Same as for a cancer patient.

57
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,657
Seventy-two hours flat
on your back and puking.

58
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,492
And a year's worth of HIV tests.

59
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,202
Alright. Now...

60
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,622
Ah!

61
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,790
I'm gonna kill
you motherfuckers.

62
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:11,460
I should mention at this point
that you're all going to die.

63
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,794
<i>Heart attack.</i>

64
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,129
<i>Car accident.</i>

65
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,464
<i>Murder.</i>

66
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:16,673
<i>Cancer.</i>

67
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,008
<i>Diabetic shock.</i>

68
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,384
<i>Fork in the toaster.</i>

69
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,345
<i>Or peanut allergy.</i>

70
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:23,638
<i>Rich, poor. Old, young.</i>

71
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,725
<i>Sometimes they don't
find you for days.</i>

72
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,477
You'll be dead too one day,

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,603
and sooner than you think.

74
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,354
Because guess what?

75
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,065
It all ends.

76
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,401
<i>You know the movie of your life?</i>

77
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,612
<i>The one you're starring in.</i>

78
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:42,323
<i>One day, that movie just
ends and you're gone.</i>

79
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,285
<i>Remember what it was like
before you were born?</i>

80
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,206
<i>It'll be just like that.</i>

81
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:51,708
<i>Forever.</i>

82
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,546
<i>But sometimes, 'cause
of people like me,</i>

83
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,966
<i>you get a little borrowed time.</i>

84
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,468
I'm gonna kill
you motherfuckers.

85
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:03,011
Get the fuck outta my house.

86
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,806
Gun! Gun!

87
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,349
Secure your scene, Taggert!

88
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,685
Secure your fuckin' scene!

89
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,020
Fuck, man. First of all,

90
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,522
I ain't know you could
run that fuckin' fast.

91
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,106
God damn, you fast!

92
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,692
Second of all, who
had a fuckin' gun?

93
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:19,194
I'm gonna fuckin' kill
dispatch for this.

94
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:21,238
She shot at us.

95
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,532
You idiot! Someone pulls
out a gun, you run!

96
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:25,367
-Clear!
-Get your fuckin' ugly-ass

97
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,827
motherfuckin' hands off me,

98
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,620
you goddamn ugly fuckin' mutt!

99
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,331
Scene's all yours, EMS.

100
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:03,030
Randy, man, you okay?

101
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:05,656
I'm fine.

102
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,456
It's gonna be
alright, okay, ma'am?

103
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,707
We're not gonna let you die.

104
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,375
Seriously, you say
that one more time,

105
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,918
I'm gonna punch
you in the throat.

106
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,754
We never say that to a patient.

107
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,339
-Ever.
-Sorry.

108
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,383
What's that?

109
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,427
This is NARCAN.

110
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:29,181
It kicks the heroin off
of the narcotic receptors.

111
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,600
This woman just
paid a lot of money

112
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,352
to get higher than Jimi Hendrix

113
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:36,772
and we're about to take that
away from her like... that.

114
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,150
Okay. Um... You know what?

115
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,568
I wouldn't sit
there if I were you.

116
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,861
Why?

117
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,780
Because...

118
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,698
...of the puke.

119
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,534
It's in my mouth!

120
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:51,578
What the fuck?!

121
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,163
What did she eat?!

122
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,123
You stole my high, motherfucker!

123
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:56,875
You're welcome.
Your life was saved.

124
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,377
We're taking you to
the hospital, ma'am.

125
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,420
You need to...
Ma'am, settle down.

126
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:03,006
Hey, no. Hey. Hey! Calm down!

127
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,591
You need to calm down!

128
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,551
Oh, shit! Her arm's free!

129
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,387
No!

130
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,472
Oh, shit! Oh, no, no, no!

131
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:13,141
No, no, no!

132
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:16,270
Got a needle!

133
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:17,854
That is illegal, ma'am!

134
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,736
Oh, God...

135
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,864
Are you kidding me?

136
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:31,076
You stuck me with
a dirty needle!

137
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,536
You shit!

138
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,956
Hey! Mike, brake!

139
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,666
What the fuck?

140
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,337
Right... right in the face.

141
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,548
Hold her down!

142
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:49,219
Hey! Now... Shit!
I fell in it! Ah!

143
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,139
You crazy bitch!

144
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:58,145
-Shit!
-Hey, hit her with the oxygen!

145
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,690
-Breathe, bitch!
-What are you doing?!

146
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,404
I said hit her with it!

147
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,163
What happened?

148
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,248
We administered oxygen.

149
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,670
Yes, and then the patient
needed to be restrained,

150
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,089
uh, thereby possibly resulting

151
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:29,051
in some self-administered
bruising.

152
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,720
Is that your medical opinion?

153
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,306
Sorry, what medical school
did you go to again, doctor?

154
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,974
-Not a doctor.
-Sorry?

155
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,770
-Not a doctor.
-That's right!

156
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:41,605
You're not a doctor.

157
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,566
So what do you say we leave
the diagnosing of the patients

158
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,360
-to the real doctors, huh?
-Okay.

159
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:47,986
I got a dirty needle
stick in the ambulance,

160
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,404
so if you'd please write
me a prescription...

161
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:50,656
-What a shitshow.
-...for retroviral...

162
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,115
You are unbelievable.

163
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,867
Hope you enjoy this
nice, clean hospital...

164
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,953
-Any dignity left in the EMS?
-...while I'm out on the streets

165
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,788
getting vomited on,
having to take pills

166
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:00,248
that smell like a
hobo shat in my mouth!

167
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:01,375
Hey!

168
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,086
In one day, I've been...

169
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,338
shot at...

170
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,094
thrown up on, and... strangled.

171
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:15,597
And what, we still have...

172
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,727
11 hours left in the shift.

173
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,188
How do you guys
do this every day?

174
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,649
It's our job.

175
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:27,317
Your job sucks!

176
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,778
Yeah, and it sounds real shitty
when you say it like that.

177
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,364
Yeah, well, I can't go
back on that ambulance.

178
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,782
Okay?

179
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,743
I quit.

180
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,163

That's bullshit! You can't
talk while intubated.

201
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,379
Crescent Premium,
how may I help you?

202
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,257
Uh, certainly. One
moment, please.

203
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,761
Crescent Premium, may
I direct your call?

204
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,438
Well, I see you've certainly
put in your time as a paramedic.

205
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,485
Well, I imagine insurance
sounds pretty boring,

206
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:36,321
but we do work under some
pretty tight timetables.

207
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:38,115
How are you at handling stress?

208
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:40,116
Well, I'm a paramedic.

209
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,744
So...

210
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:44,663
I-I'm always stressed.

211
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:47,416
Is that why you
chose insurance?

212
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:52,671
Well, uh... I think that with
my many years of experience,

213
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:55,090
uh, as a medical provider,

214
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:56,925
that transitioning to another

215
00:10:57,008 --> 00:11:00,512
kind of medical or
healthcare field,

216
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,974
I could bring, uh,
beneficial experience.

217
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,017
Beneficial how?

218
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:09,979
Well, I...

219
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,942
think that being a paramedic
is really important work.

220
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:15,860
And...

221
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:18,947
in all honesty, I got into EMS

222
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,283
'cause I really
wanted to help people.

223
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,577
But the reality is...

224
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,829
we hardly ever help anybody.

225
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:28,040
We're just kind of a mop-up crew

226
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,917
for the worst tragedies
in people's lives.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,335
You know?

228
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:36,631
And, man, I have seen stuff.

229
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,968
I mean, dead bodies
don't even register.

230
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,470
I've seen millions
of dead bodies.

231
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:46,308
Body parts. I've seen
arms and faces ripped off.

232
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:50,395
And, man, that image gets
scarred into your brain

233
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:53,565
for the rest of your
life, and I'm tired.

234
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,485
I'm tired. I just... I show up to
work first thing in the morning

235
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,862
and my first thought
is, "Fuck everybody."

236
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,447
And given the opportunity,

237
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,616
I would set fire
to that ambulance.

238
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,868
Because it's broken, Bruce.

239
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:08,747
It's broken. The whole
system is fucking broken.

240
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,332
And it's sinking

241
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:12,417
and I'm out there with a
thimble, trying to bail it out,

242
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,461
and if I make one mistake,
someone could die.

243
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,047
And you wanna know
my experience?

244
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,674
I'm burning out.

245
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:24,763
I'm burning out.

246
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,474
I'm burning out.

247
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:30,685
I'm burning out, and...

248
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,898
I need the hell out of EMS

249
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,734
before I fuck up
and kill somebody.

250
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,078
Uh... you have any
other questions?

251
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,765
22, are you 10-8 yet?

252
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,183
<i>Negative.</i>

253
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,477
<i>-Waitin' on hospital paperwork.</i>
-Waitin' on paperwork.

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,937
They are over there
hittin' on nurses.

255
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,938
That's some bullshit.

256
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,732
22, get movin'.

257
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,858
Here you go, baby.
Put that back for me?

258
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:21,861
Oh, hey, Shanice.

259
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,156
-Hey.
-Hey, Randy.

260
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,199
How'd you enjoy your week off?

261
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:29,286
Oh yeah, great. All the fun
of cancer without the cancer.

262
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:30,704
Yeah, I had a needle stick once.

263
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:32,289
Oh, I remember.

264
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:34,625
That junkie behind the
chicken place, with the hair.

265
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,752
Oh yeah, I forgot. I
was ridin' with you.

266
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:37,961
Hey, that's right.

267
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,338
Hey, listen. Um...

268
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,135
You gotta take me
off the schedule.

269
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:46,345
Please.

270
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,722
You gotta cut down
my hours, somehow.

271
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:51,558
Really. I'm in... I'm in
terrible shape, Shanice.

272
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:53,476
Shanice, listen.

273
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:58,857
-I'm not okay.
-Randy, I am sorry,

274
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,109
but I am shorthanded. I
don't have anybody else,

275
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,403
so you're in 42 with Mike.

276
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:04,988
Come on...

277
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,657
Why you always
sticking me with Mike?

278
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,450
He's the only one that can
put up wit' your prickly ass.

279
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,119
You may not know, but you're not
good at interpersonal relations,

280
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,621
and I hope that's
not a shock to you.

281
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:15,082
'Cause you know what? I
rode with you for two years

282
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,209
but you break most people
within two or three months.

283
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:20,045
Oh, come on. That's not
true. That's not fair.

284
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,255
Lots of people like
riding with me. Like Kim.

285
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,299
You like riding
with me, right, Kim?

286
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,679
Oh. You do so like
riding with me.

287
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,138
She likes riding with me.

288
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,974
Shanice, when we
gon' get a raise?

289
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:33,642
Oh, baby, I would love
to give you a raise,

290
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,644
and as soon as the government
ups our reimbursements,

291
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,145
that's when you
will get your raise.

292
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:38,897
And by the way, Randy,
you have another student.

293
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,482
-No. Unh-uh.
-Yes.

294
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:42,359
No. There's no way. No.

295
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,319
You are senior. You
get the student.

296
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:46,280
Is there another paramedic
I should put them with?

297
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,947
Somebody better than you?

298
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,320
-Nobody's better than me.
-What I thought you'd say.

299
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,707
Oh, come on, baby.
Don't do me like that.

300
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,750
You know I'm at work.

301
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,293
Look, I don't get
off 'til seven.

302
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:02,838
No, no, no, not p.m., a.m.

303
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:05,966
I can get at you at 7:30,
baby. All I need's 45 minutes.

304
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,426
That's more than
enough time, you know?

305
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:10,721
Mm-hmm, about 15 pumps.

306
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,639
Aw, yeah, you know I like that.

307
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:14,682
Randy's here. I'll
call you back.

308
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,185
Look at this old creaky bitch.

309
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,146
You know you only got
like ten summers left.

310
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:20,439
Don't start with me.

311
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,482
I haven't even
had breakfast yet.

312
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:25,277
Uh, Mike, you gonna
let me drive today?

313
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,196
Uh, no. Okay? I
drive. You know that.

314
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,198
-Come on. Come on.
-No!

315
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,618
Look, I wheel, you heal.

316
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,620
Why do you wanna upset the
natural order of things?

317
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:36,496
And look, we got a
student today too.

318
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:37,831
I know. I'm hoping
we can pull out

319
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:39,457
before that dipshit shows up.

320
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,420
Dipshit's already here.

321
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:45,547
Oh, fuckwad.

322
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,882
Or Jessica.

323
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,177
-Randy.
-Hey, Randy.

324
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,554
-Thanks for having me.
-Hey!

325
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,432
You know something?
You seem pretty smart.

326
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,100
Bet you on the top of
your paramedic class

327
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,185
and everything, ain't ya?

328
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,062
Hmm. Pretty smart.

329
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:01,396
I'm smart too.

330
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,106
Game recognize game.

331
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:05,442
-Okay.
-Listen up.

332
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:09,029
We work a 24-hour shift,
from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

333
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,906
You really wanna spend 24 hours

334
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,241
in this hot box with
two sweaty dudes?

335
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:16,328
-Yep.
-You're gonna see things

336
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:18,288
that you can't unsee.

337
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,083
I'm sorry, did I make a mistake?

338
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,627
Because I asked Shanice
to set me up with the best

339
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,587
because I wanna learn
from the best, so...

340
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,882
am I in the wrong truck, or...?

341
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,301
Okay. Alright. You
wanna tag along, fine,

342
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,095
but here's what you're gonna do.

343
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:34,262
Nothing.

344
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:36,264
You are going to do nothing,

345
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,808
you are going to touch nothing,

346
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:39,476
you are going to say nothing

347
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,603
unless I instruct you
to. You understand?

348
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:44,398
This is not a democracy,
it's a dictatorship.

349
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,566
Okay? What I say goes.

350
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,401
Period. End of story.

351
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,531
Alright, "dick-tator."
Let's hit it.

352
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:58,954
<i>♪ What kinda whips are
you driving around in? ♪</i>

353
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,540
<i>♪ I like 'em brown, yellow,
candy-coated and spacious ♪</i>

354
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:04,209
{\an8}<i>♪ What kinda whips are
you driving around in... ♪</i>

355
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,253
{\an8}What the hell? We're
supposed to be saving lives

356
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,546
{\an8}and you're getting a latte?

357
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,923
{\an8}We don't get lunch breaks
or bathroom breaks.

358
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,758
We got 24 hours ahead of us,

359
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,927
we gotta grab what
we can when we can,

360
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,511
and right now I am starving.

361
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:16,721
Hey!

362
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,557
Do you guys really have
to park like this, man?

363
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,684
You're taking up like
three fucking spots.

364
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,104
We park that way in case
we have to leave quickly

365
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,315
in an emergency, sir.

366
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:29,151
You know what? All you
people do is tie up traffic.

367
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,986
You know that? You should
get a fuckin' real job.

368
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,362
How 'bout that?

369
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:34,573
Hey, dipshit, we do
have a real fuckin' job.

370
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:37,576
What do you do with this
plastic-ass name tag, Kevin?

371
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,786
Huh? Go back to
RadioShack, motherfucker!

372
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,538
-Chill out, man.
-I don't have to chill the fu...

373
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,582
-You chill the fuck out!
-What an asshole.

374
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,126
-Yeah, people are mean.
-Fuck you. I'm not chilling!

375
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,544
You'll see.

376
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,213
Fuckin' handlebar
mustache bitch.

377
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,883
Yeah, I'm sorry, Mama.

378
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,803
Uh, coffee and a muffin.

379
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,180
No, you know what?

380
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:00,265
Two muffins. One
chocolate, one blueberry.

381
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:03,226
Two muffins, one
coffee. That is...

382
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,769
$10.25.

383
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,689
Um...

384
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,860
-Free coffee for heroes.
-Oh.

385
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,821
Free coffee for firemen
and policemen only.

386
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,491
I'm a paramedic.

387
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,076
<i>Medic 42, emergency traffic.</i>

388
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,327
Sorry...

389
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,331
<i>Medic 42, respond emergent</i>

390
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,375
<i>to 5200 West Imperial Highway</i>

391
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,709
<i>for psychiatric patient.</i>

392
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:29,836
Oh, it's your boy Johnny.

393
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,381
Man, I hope he's
wearing clothes today.

394
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:34,883
You know something?
I bet ya he's not.

395
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:37,177
Matter of fact, 20 bucks say
he's gonna be butt-ass naked.

396
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,137
-Oh, no way.
-Twenty dollars.

397
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,380
-Bet you right now.
-I'm in.

398
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,140
You're payin' for my lunch today

399
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,433
'cause he gon' be
fuckin' butt-ass naked.

400
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:44,476
-Let's do this.
-Let's do it.

401
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,144
-Come on, big money.
-Okay.

402
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,105
Hey, student of the year,
what do you think? You in?

403
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,524
-Balls in or out?
-Balls?

404
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:02,202
I am Satan and his
only messenger!

405
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,496
Well, there you have
it. It's a draw.

406
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,914
Shirt, no pants.

407
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,458
What are you talkin' 'bout?
That's bullshit, okay?

408
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,335
I can see his dick.
That qualifies.

409
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,503
He's not naked!

410
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,797
How'd you call that naked?
He's wearing a shirt.

411
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,591
Shirt, no pants. That's
like, uh... Winnie the Pooh.

412
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:18,093
I guess Winnie the
Pooh got his dick out

413
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,178
because I can see
Winnie the Pooh's dick.

414
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,014
Johnny, bring your
naked ass over here!

415
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:24,141
Leave this place...

416
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:25,976
or I'll destroy you all!

417
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,854
Oh, oh. Okay, so you really
wanna test your immortality?

418
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,981
-Okay.
-Leave now!

419
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,531
I am Satan and his
only messenger.

420
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,992
Man, that's greedy as
fuck. You cannot be Satan

421
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,619
<i>and</i> his only messenger.

422
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:46,079
Just pick one, okay? Got
too many fuckin' jobs!

423
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,541
I am Satan and his
only messenger!

424
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,001
Okay. You know what?

425
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,086
Have some breakfast. But...

426
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,172
leave people alone.
Lay low. Okay?

427
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,633
Or I'm gonna hook the
defibrillator up to your face.

428
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:58,967
Bzz! You understand?

429
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,886
It don't matter. Put
some fuckin' pants on

430
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:02,679
and get your ashy leprechaun
ass from over here.

431
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:03,930
Nobody wanna see that shit!

432
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:05,598
Satan does!

433
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,517
What...

434
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,020
County, it's Medic 42.

435
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,189
We are available.
No patient on scene.

436
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:13,815
Repeat, no patient on scene.

437
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:15,776
Wait. What are you doing?
You abandoned your patient.

438
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:17,277
You could lose your license.

439
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,404
-Satan loves me!
-That is not a patient.

440
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,656
That is Johnny.

441
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:22,032
If he was actively schizo,

442
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,200
he'd be pulling out his hair

443
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,077
and biting his lips
until they bleed.

444
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,579
That's what Johnny does
when he's not on his meds.

445
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:30,915
Right now, Johnny's acting
this way because he's hungry.

446
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,751
-Oh, he's hungry. Yeah.
-Yes.

447
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,795
The guy wagging his dick around.

448
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,463
-Yeah.
-That... He's hungry.

449
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:38,423
He wants us to take
him into the ER

450
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:40,926
where they have to give him a
meal before they let him go,

451
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,970
because the ER has no choice.

452
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,056
They legally can't
turn anyone away.

453
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:48,934
Now, we could bring him
in for his ER happy meal,

454
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,436
but guess what? There's a
shit-ton of paperwork involved.

455
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,647
So it's a lot easier for
me to skip the middleman

456
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,233
and give him my breakfast.
And I'm starving!

457
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,735
Okay. So just to recap.

458
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:01,613
Your medical
solution is muffins.

459
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,784
I sacrificed my
delicious muffins

460
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,035
for the good of humanity.

461
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,205
-Mike, let's roll.
-Alright. We outta here.

462
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,337
Why are you here?

463
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:20,132
Because I wanna save lives.

464
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:24,219
-Is that funny?
-You wanna save lives.

465
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:25,595
You think we savin' lives?

466
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:27,347
Come on, now. We just
gave a dude muffins.

467
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,224
Yeah, I used to
want to be a hero,

468
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:32,269
but the fact is,
we're not heroes.

469
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay?

470
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:35,897
The fact is that most
of the calls we get

471
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,149
are bullshit.

472
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:38,400
The people that
need us don't call,

473
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,402
and the people that
call don't need us.

474
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,029
People live, people die.

475
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:44,990
You rarely make any kind
of difference whatsoever.

476
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,158
This is a job.

477
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,202
Okay? You clock
in, you clock out.

478
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,371
At the end of the day
you go home. That's it.

479
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:52,956
I don't think you
really believe that.

480
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,583
No, I do.

481
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,960
I do. I really, really do.

482
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,670
And you should too
if you want to last.

483
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:01,048
But you have people's
lives in your hands.

484
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:03,467
How can you not care? How
can you not give a shit?

485
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,759
Caring is what kills you.

486
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:06,637
The fact is,

487
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,930
most people in this
job can't last a year.

488
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:10,223
They can't hack it.

489
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,267
And the good ones, the
really, really good ones?

490
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,560
Five years.

491
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:15,478
Five years, max. That's
all they can handle.

492
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,441
How long have you been doing it?

493
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:24,321
Eighteen years, nine months.

494
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:34,581
Alright, class president,

495
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:36,144
this one's for real,
so pay attention.

496
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,126
You're with me. Grab the bag.

497
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,544
-Okay.
-Don't touch anything.

498
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:40,462
Nothing. Got it?

499
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:41,797
But then why am I...

500
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,506
...even here?

501
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,348
Walk. Don't run. Never run.

502
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,724
-Why?
-Why?

503
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,476
Oh, shit. Door's stuck.

504
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,814
-BSI.
-What?

505
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,065
-BSI!
-What the fuck is that?

506
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,650
-Put your gloves on!
-Oh. Okay.

507
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,318
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Hey.

508
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,903
Need you to pop that door.

509
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,239
-Got it.
-Also need an additional driver.

510
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,657
I need Mike in the back with me.

511
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,117
-We're on it.
-Hey. Everything's okay?

512
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:13,578
What is that?

513
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:16,039
I answer questions
after the fact.

514
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,668
It's a window punch.

515
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:23,797
Okay, go ahead.

516
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,007
Pull her out the side.

517
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,383
-Move in.
-Little more.

518
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,803
Alright, head of her class,

519
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:30,929
what do we assess first?

520
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:32,723
Airway, breathing, circulation.

521
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,641
He's breathing, but
it's rapid deep breaths.

522
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,267
Kussmauls?

523
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:38,186
Wait, am I right?

524
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:39,854
Rookie, get out the way.

525
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:41,565
What's goin' on here?

526
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:43,358
Got Kussmauls.

527
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:46,069
Possible broken
everything. What about you?

528
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:47,988
Lady was just a little
shook up but she's alright.

529
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:49,781
Alright. Grab me
a collar, will ya?

530
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,408
Okay, I got you.

531
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:52,992
-Get out the way.
-Sorry. Sorry.

532
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:56,705
Alright, and grab
me a non-rebreather.

533
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,582
You just said not
to touch anything.

534
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,876
And now I'm asking you
to touch a non-rebreather

535
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,127
and bring it to me.

536
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,170
Wait. No. No.

537
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:07,215
Sorry. Sorry.

538
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:08,884
Not in the truck. In the bag!

539
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,219
-The what?
-In the bag! In the bag!

540
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:12,638
Oh, shit.

541
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,180
Walk. Don't run.

542
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,685
Hey, buddy. Can you hear me?

543
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,482
One, two, three.

544
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:26,985
One, two, three.

545
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:29,154
No. Yeah, I got him.

546
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,989
How am I doin'?

547
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:32,032
Alright.

548
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,076
Nothing in the belly,
good in all four.

549
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,702
Got this, hero?

550
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,581
Oh, shit. He's in V-fib.

551
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:41,917
You, I need you to do CPR.

552
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,835
Now. Go. Go!

553
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:50,967
Harder.

554
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,303
Harder! You're not
doing anything.

555
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:54,554
Harder!

556
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:56,556
Oh, God! I think I
just broke his ribs.

557
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,308
No, no, no. That's a
good thing. A good thing.

558
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,102
Don't stop, okay? Means
you're doing it right.

559
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:02,354
Yeah. I can fix broken.
I can't fix dead.

560
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:04,064
Come on!

561
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,155
Um, are we gonna shock him?

562
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,074
No, we gonna wax his chest.

563
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:15,534
Yes, we gonna shock him.

564
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,785
Charging.

565
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,745
Clear.

566
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:21,039
Brainiac is clear. All clear.

567
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,008
Comin' through.

568
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:32,843
Hello? Hello, hello!

569
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:36,555
Got approximately 40-year-old
male, two-car MVA.

570
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,432
Restrained driver.

571
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:40,183
Severe damage to the vehicle.

572
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,686
Ten-minute extrication.

573
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:44,813
Kussmauls at first,

574
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,691
but once we got him out
went apneic and V-fib.

575
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:50,068
Been shocked three times.
Last was on the drive here.

576
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,069
Now asystolic.

577
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,405
Ready? One, two, three.

578
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:57,784
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

579
00:25:57,867 --> 00:26:00,287
Fractured right arm and
depressed skull fracture in...

580
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,123
Hold compression. Just
hold, hold, hold. Please.

581
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,541
He's asystolic.

582
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,836
You said he was traumatic.
Did you ever get a pulse back?

583
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,046
-No.
-No.

584
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,338
No.

585
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:13,717
Time of death, 10:29.

586
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,011
Oh, God. You gotta
be shitting me.

587
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:17,762
Is that mud?

588
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,807
Well, nice job, Dr. Randy.

589
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,226
Just track all the mud
and bacteria you want

590
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,394
into my ER.

591
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,734
Seriously?

592
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,247
Hey. What happened?

593
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:47,250
The doctor just
called it? That's it?

594
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,086
Yes, that's it.

595
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:51,088
Dude was dead when we got there.

596
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:52,839
Okay, well, if you
thought he was dead,

597
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:54,800
then why did you make me do CPR?

598
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:57,886
Because nobody dies
in an ambulance.

599
00:26:57,969 --> 00:26:59,262
What do you mean?
It's an ambulance.

600
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:02,808
-People die all the time.
-Nobody dies in the ambulance.

601
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:05,352
It's a legal nightmare. Once
we start working on you,

602
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,020
we're not allowed
to declare you dead.

603
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:08,939
Only a doctor or
coroner can do that.

604
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:11,149
So even if he has zero
chance of making it,

605
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,903
even if we're just pumping
blood through a corpse,

606
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:16,780
we cannot declare him dead.

607
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:18,740
Now, he can be dead
before we show up,

608
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:20,826
he can be dead once
we drop him off,

609
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,953
but never, ever in between.

610
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,541
That doesn't make
any medical sense.

611
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:29,084
It's not medicine.

612
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,503
It's healthcare.

613
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:33,213
Welcome to EMS.

614
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:43,515
No.

615
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,767
No! Goddamnit.

616
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:48,353
Stay.

617
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:50,855
No! Go!

618
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:54,192
Take my dollar,
you motherfucker!

619
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:55,985
Goddamnit!

620
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,364
Children can hear you.

621
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:00,990
Fine. Good. You have a dollar?

622
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:05,120
What I don't understand is,
if you hate your job so much,

623
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:06,371
why don't you just quit?

624
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:09,708
'Cause I like to eat and I don't
like to sleep in the gutter.

625
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,501
-So get another job.
-Like what?

626
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,253
Like airline pilot? Huh?

627
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:15,422
Listen, I've tried.
I am stuck here.

628
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:16,715
Okay? Work at the hospital?

629
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,676
All I'm qualified to do is
change bedpans and wipe asses.

630
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,511
My training doesn't
mean shit here.

631
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:22,721
Go to med school? Forget it.

632
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:24,056
No. By the time I finish,

633
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,641
it will be time
for me to retire.

634
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,477
Okay.

635
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,979
Wait. What? No!

636
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,940
God! I hate you!

637
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,733
No! No! No!

638
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,401
God!

639
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:41,657
Okay.

640
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,325
Randy?

641
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:46,161
Oh, Christ. I feel like my
heart's coming out my asshole.

642
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:47,829
Hey. Hey.

643
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:49,414
What's the matter?

644
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,083
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

645
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,585
-You havin' a heart attack?
-No. Just stop it. God.

646
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:55,629
-No.
-Okay, so it's a panic attack.

647
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:58,632
-No, it's not.
-Take some slow, deep breaths.

648
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:00,884
Uh, hello? Paramedic.

649
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,595
Are you okay to work like this?

650
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,975
Look, I'm gonna
be fine. I just...

651
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:13,397
Just need some-some time.

652
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,192
You don't understand.

653
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,585
You know, when I was 13...

654
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,463
my mom and my sister
and I went camping

655
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:39,964
in the middle of nowhere.

656
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,469
And my mom really
liked cold chicken,

657
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:46,013
so we were eating cold chicken

658
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:48,181
on a picnic table with
some potato chips,

659
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,309
and my mom got a piece
stuck in her throat.

660
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:56,356
And I didn't... I didn't know
the Heimlich or anything...

661
00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:58,400
so right there...

662
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,861
in that dumb campground...

663
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,573
...my mother died.

664
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:08,284
And I just watched.

665
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,209
So that's why I'm...
that's why I'm here.

666
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,174
I'm gonna tell you something

667
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:24,467
that I wish someone had
told me a long time ago.

668
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:29,347
Run away from this job as
fast as humanly possible...

669
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:32,350
or you will end up like this.

670
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:41,067
That's weird.

671
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:46,114
Uh, hello? This is Randy.

672
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,625
Okay.

673
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:01,378
Okay.

674
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:04,758
What you mean you can't be late?

675
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,428
I know you're a teacher.
Fuck those kids.

676
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:10,180
Just don't... It's
too early to be...

677
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:12,307

678

00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,442

683

Yeah!

685
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,159
Hey! I quit!

686
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:32,703
I quit!

687
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:34,204
I got a new job. I'm quitting!

688
00:31:34,287 --> 00:31:35,914
That's it. I'm done.

689
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:38,250
I'm done. I got a new
job. I can't believe...

690
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,168
I totally thought that
I blew the interview,

691
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,920
but apparently they
loved my honesty.

692
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:44,715
So... that's it. I'm outta here.

693
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:46,300
So... It's...

694
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,343
Shanice, you've been amazing.
It's not you. Really.

695
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:49,845
Thanks. You're the
best supervisor.

696
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:51,096
I really... Thank you s...

697
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,639
I don't need to give
you two weeks, do I?

698
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:54,391
I don't think I could
stay another two weeks.

699
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,560
I can't do two weeks' notice.
They need me to start Monday.

700
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:59,521
Come on. Please, please
I... I can't believe it!

701
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:02,482
Honestly, I didn't know
that I could feel happy.

702
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,860
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

703
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:06,236
Yes, I'm still here.

704
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,114
Can we, uh, re-up
on rubber gloves,

705
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:10,866
hypos, and normal
saline... Hang on!

706
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,451
Randy!

707
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:13,785
I did not say you could quit.

708
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,246
And you have to
finish your shift!

709
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:18,290
-Asshole.
<i>-Excuse me?</i>

710
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:19,373
No, no, no! Not you.

711
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:23,629
{\an8}Okay! We ride!

712
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:24,963
{\an8}We ride!

713
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:26,340
Ha-ha!

714
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,933
<i>♪
It's my last day-ay! ♪</i>

715
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:39,352
<i>♪ It's my last day-ay! ♪</i>

716
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,772
<i>♪ It's my last day-ay! ♪</i>

717
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:43,899
<i>♪ It's my last day! ♪</i>

718
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:46,193
Whoo!

719
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,779
So long, fuckers!

720
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:50,030
Yeah!

721
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:55,994
Ah...

722
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:58,455
I love the smell of nursing
home in the morning.

723
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:03,585
How you doin'?

724
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:07,339
Hmm. What's for lunch?

725
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:08,965
What the fuck is wrong wit' you?

726
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:10,550
Sorry?

727
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,219
This happiness is
making me uncomfortable.

728
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:13,595
It's actually kinda
freaking me out.

729
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,138
Yeah, it's a little unnerving.

730
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:19,017
Well, in 18 more hours, I
am done with EMS forever.

731
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:22,187
Uh, hi. Hello.

732
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,605
What took you so long?

733
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,023
What you mean what
took us so long?

734
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,566
We got here in six minutes.

735
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,568
That's two R&B
songs. Six minutes.

736
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:30,028
We can't get here
faster than six minutes.

737
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,947
The fuck you think
we got, a teleporter?

738
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,448
Uh, where's the patient?

739
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:35,325
Alright, look. Just-Just...

740
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:37,202
follow me.

741
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:38,745
This way.

742
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:39,913
Come on.

743
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,207
How the fuck did
he get this job?

744
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,460
She's been having a little
trouble breathing lately.

745
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,921
Define "lately."

746
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,217
Newbie, what's your assessment?

747
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:55,470
Well, she's cyanotic,
appears to have lividity.

748
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:57,264
In my professional opinion...

749
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:58,432
she's dead.

750
00:33:58,515 --> 00:33:59,766
Hmm.

751
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,812
-You gotta do something.
-Do something? What? CPR?

752
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:05,314
She's dead.

753
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:07,064
Got a better chance of
reviving the nightstand.

754
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:08,233
You gotta try.

755
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:09,318
No, we're not touching her.

756
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,819
-Unh-uh.
-Alright.

757
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:13,488
I'm gettin' the charge nurse.

758
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:14,906
You can if you want to.

759
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,908
Is the charge nurse a magician?

760
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:19,453
Because that's the only way
this lady is coming back alive.

761
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:20,537
With magic!

762
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:22,164
Waste of time.

763
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,832
Even the newbie
knew she was dead.

764
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,876
No offense.

765
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,085
I am offended.

766
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,504
Hey, County. Medic 42.

767
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,214
<i>Medic 42, this is
County. Go ahead.</i>

768
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,760
County, we need a coroner.

769
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:36,094
We have a DOA on the scene

770
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:38,305
and, uh, we're standing
by for paperwork.

771
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,473
<i>Copy, 42. Contacting coroner.</i>

772
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,810
What do you mean, coroner?
What's going on here?

773
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:46,521
Your patient is assuming
room temperature,

774
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:47,856
I declared her dead,

775
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,066
the coroner is coming,
and we are going to leave.

776
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:51,944
How do you know she's dead?

777
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,403
What are her vitals?

778
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:55,864
You wanna know her vitals?

779
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:58,658
Well, if you must
know, zero pulse,

780
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:01,453
zero over zero blood pressure,

781
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:02,996
zero respirations.

782
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,124
Like all... zeroes.

783
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,336
Would you like to
know her blood sugar?

784
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:12,047
She was just fine when I checked
on her a few minutes ago.

785
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,883
A few... minutes ago? Really?

786
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,052
Shake her hand.

787
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,262
Go over and shake her hand.

788
00:35:19,846 --> 00:35:21,264
Do it.

789
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:23,349
-I'm good.
-Mike?

790
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:33,943
Look.

791
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,527
Look!

792
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:38,615
"Hi. I'm dead."

793
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:41,326
Goddamn, she cold.

794
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,620
You know why she's fuckin' cold?

795
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:45,122
Because this is rigor.

796
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:46,832
'Cause she's dead.

797
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:49,376
This type of stiffness
don't take a few minutes.

798
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,921
We talkin' five or six hours.

799
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,007
Huh? You can iron
your clothes on her,

800
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,091
that's how stiff she is!

801
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:57,467
Stiff as a board!

802
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,135
Can I be honest wit' you?

803
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:02,222
You're probably the worst nurse

804
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:04,766
I've ever fuckin' met.

805
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,977
This is totally unacceptable.

806
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,312
I'm calling your supervisor.

807
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:09,938
Oh. Please do.

808
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,773
That would be hysterical.

809
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:15,152
In the meantime, I suggest
you get Mrs. Pustelli on ice.

810
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:18,030
She's starting to add to the
lovely aroma around here.

811
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:19,615
I smell dead people.

812
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:27,789
-Hello!
<i>-Randy,</i>

813
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:29,499
who is this nursing home lady

814
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:30,959
screaming at me
on the other line?

815
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:32,502
Look, these people
are idiots, okay?

816
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,755
They had a patient of theirs
that was dead for hours.

817
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:37,633
<i>Randy, you have got to
learn to manage these people</i>

818
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:39,259
<i>and stop acting like an
asshole to everybody.</i>

819
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:41,470
Now I gotta deal with this mess.

820
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,180
What do... It's my
last day, Shanice.

821
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:45,057
It's not <i>my</i> last day, and
if you finish your shift

822
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,350
we'll see if it's your last.

823
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:48,560
Really? Oh, no. This
is definitely my...

824
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:49,728
I said what I said.

825
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:52,981
Fuck.

826
00:36:53,106 --> 00:36:55,067
So, Carol, if you were
assessing that patient,

827
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,776
would you classify
them as alive?

828
00:36:57,902 --> 00:36:59,655
I see. No, no, no.
No, you're right.

829
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,365
I don't have a nursing degree.

830
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:02,824
I was trained as a paramedic.

831
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:05,160
Uh-huh. Well, let me ask
you something, Carol,

832
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:07,037
since you deal in elder care.

833
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,706
My grandmother died 12
years ago at the age of 99

834
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:11,583
and we buried her
next to my grandfather

835
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,794
at that cemetery out by
the airport. Know the one?

836
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:15,629
Uh-huh. Well, let
me ask you this.

837
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:17,923
If you and I were to go out
there together right now

838
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:19,299
and dig up my
grandmother's corpse,

839
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:20,926
do you think you
could revive her?

840
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:22,511
Because that makes
about as much sense

841
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:24,388
as what you're saying
to me right now.

842
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:27,015
Your patient was dead, bitch.

843
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:28,934
Mm-hmm. And your people
didn't realize it

844
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:30,560
for five or six <i>hours.</i>

845
00:37:30,643 --> 00:37:32,396
That is called negligence.

846
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,064
But you thought
you'd just call 911

847
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,774
and cover your
asses, is that it?

848
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:39,111
Ah. Well, how 'bout you and
I call your administrator

849
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:41,071
and go over this
incident point by point

850
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:43,323
and see which one of us
still has a goddamn job

851
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:44,741
by the end of the day?

852
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,578
Oh! You're suddenly okay?

853
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:50,789
We're clear now, Carol?

854
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:52,291
Great. Well, if you
have any more problems,

855
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:54,084
my name is Shanice, you
call me immediately.

856
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,711
You got that?

857
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:57,004
Damn right.

858
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:04,886
Oh my God, I am so hungry.

859
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:06,638
Mike, find a taco
truck or something.

860
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:08,932
My stomach is eating itself.

861
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:10,392
I got you. That's
all you have to say.

862
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,102
You didn't really quit, did you?

863
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,270
Yeah. I did.

864
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,398
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah, I did.

865
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:17,691
No, you did not.

866
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:19,401
Yes, I did.

867
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:21,570
Look, look. Let
me say this, okay?

868
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:24,031
Randy has been in this
way too long, okay?

869
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,700
EMS is not supposed to
be working this long.

870
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:29,369
He don't know what he's gonna
do out in the real world.

871
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:30,579
This motherfucker can't do shit.

872
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:32,331
What are you talking about?

873
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:33,915
I wouldn't know how
to function out there?

874
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:35,709
Oh, but you know how
to function out there.

875
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,127
-You damn right I do.
-Yeah.

876
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,712
I function well out there too.

877
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,422
'Cause I'm a normal
fuckin' person.

878
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,507
I go home, I take a shit,

879
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,551
then I take a shower
and I put on my clothes

880
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:46,261
and I pick up my
lady, we go to dinner,

881
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:47,929
then we come back
home and we fuck.

882
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,224
Okay? That is called
being a part of society.

883
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:52,643
You, on the other hand,

884
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,853
would not survive one
day in the real world.

885
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,189
'Cause he ain't did shit.
Don't do nothin' besides this.

886
00:38:57,272 --> 00:38:58,940
When the last time
you been on a date?

887
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:02,903
Hmm? When was the last time
you washed your fuckin' sheets?

888
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,821
Oh...

889
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,743
Well, where are you gonna work?

890
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,787
I'm working in an
insurance company.

891
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,789
-What?!
-What?

892
00:39:13,872 --> 00:39:15,290
-Are you...
-What?

893
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,209
You gon' work in
insurance. Please.

894
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:19,002
Man, you can't even
work at fuckin' Subway.

895
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:21,588
I could w... I could
too work at Subway.

896
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,632
You gotta deal with
customers to work at Subway.

897
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:25,175
Yeah. I could deal
with customers.

898
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:26,969
You could? Let's
pretend I'm a customer.

899
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,387
-Okay.
-Okay. You ready?

900
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,846
-Yeah.
-I walk in. Ding!

901
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:31,431
The little bell go
off. I'm in there.

902
00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:33,392
Oh, hello, sir. Are
you having a nice day?

903
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,559
I'm having a great day.

904
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:35,852
I would like a
sandwich for lunch.

905
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:37,312
-Okay.
-You really supposed to...

906
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:38,981
Would you like a
six-inch or a foot long?

907
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:41,775
Okay. I want a six-inch
vegetarian sub, okay?

908
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:43,985
-On wheat with chicken.
-Mm-hmm.

909
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,489
-Hmm.
-Okay.

910
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:50,200
Uh... that-that doesn't make it

911
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:51,868
a vegetarian sub
if you add chicken.

912
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,413
No. I would like, like I said,

913
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:57,749
a six-inch vegetarian sub
on wheat with chicken.

914
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:59,543
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that

915
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:00,961
'cause that's not
a vegetarian sub.

916
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:02,629
Motherfucker, it is.

917
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:04,840
-I'm the customer.
-If you have chicken on it...

918
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,675
See? That's exactly why
you couldn't work there.

919
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,635
-But it's not vegetarian!
-It is vegetarian!

920
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:11,638
There are rules here,
sir. There are rules.

921
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,973
I can order whatever the
fuck I want. Alright?

922
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:16,059
I want a orange Fanta

923
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:17,394
with grape juice in it.

924
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,062
You can serve your
own drink, sir.

925
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:21,064
Here's your cup. Go
to the drink station.

926
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:22,691
What type of racist
shit is that?!

927
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:25,277
Fuck that. I'm
calling corporate.

928
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,195
Beep-beep-boop-beep-beep.
Corporate.

929
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:30,699
Hey! This dude named Randy
that work at the Subway

930
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:32,409
is a asshole, okay?

931
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:35,453
He tried to make me make
my own fuckin' drink!

932
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:37,914
Also this is a
Black man calling,

933
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:39,166
so you know what that's about!

934
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,709
Bye! Fired!

935
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,211
-Shit.
-Alright. Alright.

936
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,505
Well, you know what? I'm
not working at Subway,

937
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:47,049
so... win-win.

938
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:48,466
<i>Medic 42.</i>

939
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,969
No. Come on!

940
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:53,221
Not now. Don't take it.
No. No. No, Mike. Please.

941
00:40:53,304 --> 00:40:55,057
Come on, man. It's our job.

942
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,558
-42 is here. Go ahead.
-Oh, God.

943
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,435
<i>Medic 42, emergency traffic.</i>

944
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:00,395
<i>Respond emergent
in 33 Cooper Court.</i>

945
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:04,024
Oh man, I hope this patient
is dead so I can eat...

946
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:06,151
...a taco.

947
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:21,875
Oh, this is gonna
be fucked up.

948
00:41:26,963 --> 00:41:28,548
Hey. Hey. Sir?

949
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,259
S-Sir, excuse me. We just...
We just wanna take a look at...

950
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:32,719
Yeah. Hey.

951
00:41:33,762 --> 00:41:36,556
-What?
-Hey, sir, uh...

952
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,393
Why don't you get on the ground
so we can help you out, okay?

953
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:41,436
-Here, come here.
-Should I take my helmet off?

954
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,813
No!

955
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:43,855
-No.
-No.

956
00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:45,607
Real s... No! Okay.

957
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,775
Goddamnit.

958
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,445
{\an8}-Better...
-Oh.

959
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:52,781
{\an8}You've had a little too much
to drink this afternoon?

960
00:41:52,864 --> 00:41:54,616
{\an8}-Just a little.
-Be right back.

961
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:56,059
{\an8}I'ma get the rest
of the equipment.

962
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,495
{\an8}Hold C-spine, please, madame.

963
00:41:58,578 --> 00:42:00,372
{\an8}-Yep.
-Thank you.

964
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:01,873
{\an8}Hello there. My name's Randy.

965
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:03,875
{\an8}We're gonna be taking you
to the hospital today.

966
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,837
{\an8}-What's your name?
-Uh, my name's Matt.

967
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,171
{\an8}Or Matthew.

968
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:09,381
{\an8}Okay, Matthew.

969
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,842
{\an8}I'm, uh... just
wondering if you...

970
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:13,927
{\an8}Know what? Maybe call
me Matt, actually.

971
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,138
{\an8}-That feels more like...
-Okay, Matt.

972
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:18,890
{\an8}Matt it is. Any other
pain anywhere? Hmm?

973
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:21,101
{\an8}Eh, just like...
a little headache,

974
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:22,894
{\an8}but I don't think
it's a big deal, doc.

975
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:25,564
{\an8}Uh, not a doc. Paramedic.

976
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:27,357
{\an8}Can you tell us a bit
about what happened?

977
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:29,735
{\an8}Uh, yeah.

978
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:31,069
{\an8}I crashed my bike...

979
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:32,404
{\an8}-Oh, hey!
-Okay!

980
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,615
-We wanna hold you real still.
-Sorry.

981
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:35,949
Real still.

982
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:40,787
{\an8}I don't have to go to the
haps... hospital, do I?

983
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,997
{\an8}'Cause I don't have insurance.

984
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,707
{\an8}Matt, don't worry about that.

985
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,543
{\an8}They're just gonna send you a
soul-crushing bill later on.

986
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,920
Excuse me. Excuse
me. I'm a nurse!

987
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:50,922
Excuse me. I'm a nurse.

988
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,967
I saw the ambulance and
figured you'd need help.

989
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,344
Let's get this helmet off.

990
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,511
You don't have to do that.

991
00:42:56,594 --> 00:42:58,805
Lady, I don't wanna
be mean to you

992
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:00,724
'cause you remind
me of my auntie,

993
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:01,975
but leave us the fuck alone.

994
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:03,977
Is this like a turf war over me?

995
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,687
Right. I need you
to bandage his eyes.

996
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,605
What's wrong with my eyes?

997
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,946
Eyes. Both. Both eyes.

998
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:15,864
Why? The other eye's fine.

999
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:17,991
Not a democracy.

1000
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:20,160
-Both eyes.
-That doesn't make any sense.

1001
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:23,329
-Why would I do that?
-Both eyes.

1002
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,671
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing?

1003
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:33,006
Because, like, it sounds
like you don't agree.

1004
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:35,217
Oh, we know exactly
what we're doing.

1005
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,885
Let him see out of his good eye.

1006
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:40,555
Taggert! Escort this lady out
of my presence immediately.

1007
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:41,723
What?

1008
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:44,017
-Come with me, ma'am. Let's go.
-Out.

1009
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,477
I'm not leaving my patient.

1010
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,437
-Mm-hmm.
-No. This is <i>my</i> patient!

1011
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,438
Mine!

1012
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:53,860
Sorry. I'm trying
to understand.

1013
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:55,153
Did you have me wrap both eyes

1014
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:56,738
because you didn't
want him to panic?

1015
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:58,615
What did I say? Not in
front of the patient.

1016
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:00,617
-I-I don't understand.
-Not in front of the patient!

1017
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,953
-I'm trying to understand.
-Dictator, remember? Dictator!

1018
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:04,454
Yeah, dic-something.

1019
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,373
I can hear you guys.

1020
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Matt, or Matty.

1021
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,670
-42-year-old male.
-Matthew.

1022
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:13,714
Conscious but not
alert. ETOH on board.

1023
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:15,299
Penetrating injury
to his right eye.

1024
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:18,093
As far as we can tell,
no neuro involvement.

1025
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:21,513
Vitals are stable. No SOB
or other injuries detected.

1026
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,390
Wow. That wasn't
interesting at all.

1027
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:25,642
'Cause to me, what
I'm seeing here

1028
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:27,602
is a stick in the eye!

1029
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:30,479
What?

1030
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,982
I'm sorry, sir. Your
eye, it's, um...

1031
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:34,983
jelly.

1032
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:36,695
Aw, man!

1033
00:44:36,778 --> 00:44:38,822
I can sew it up and
give you an eye patch.

1034
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:40,949
That's the best I can
do for you, though.

1035
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:43,284
You can thank your
friends in EMS.

1036
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,371
I did everything right.

1037
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,498
Get out of my ER.

1038
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:58,007
That guy's a dick.

1039
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:00,510
No, no, no.

1040
00:45:00,593 --> 00:45:01,887
No, no. Why both eyes?

1041
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,513
-It is a reasonable question.
-Listen.

1042
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:04,890
Our patient is
scared and confused

1043
00:45:04,973 --> 00:45:06,892
and he needs to know we know
what the fuck we're doing.

1044
00:45:06,975 --> 00:45:08,393
So stop asking questions
in front of him

1045
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:09,603
like a fucking five-year-old.

1046
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:11,229
Know what? I came
here to learn from you

1047
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:13,065
because I thought you had
something to teach me.

1048
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:14,316
Instead, you give me bullshit

1049
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:15,567
about how saving
lives doesn't matter

1050
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,777
because you're dead inside.

1051
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,654
You're everything I don't
want to be. Everything.

1052
00:45:18,737 --> 00:45:20,864
-Shh! Shh!
-Top to bottom. What kind of...

1053
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:22,991
Boo-hoo. Are you jaded?
Are you Mr. Tough Guy?

1054
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:24,785
-What's behind the eyes?
-The brain.

1055
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:27,287
Right. And do we want that stick
moving, carving up the brain?

1056
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,039
-No, we don't.
-No. We do not. Right?

1057
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:30,749
-How many eyes do we have?
-Oh, come on.

1058
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:33,293
-How many eyes do we have?!
-Two! We have two.

1059
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:34,753
Do they work independently?

1060
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,006
Oh, shit.

1061
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:39,340
Yeah.

1062
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:41,342
Where one eye moves...

1063
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:43,803
the other one follows.

1064
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,973
They move in tandem.

1065
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,432
How far is that
stick back there?

1066
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,101
We don't know. Is it
digging up the brain?

1067
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:50,519
We don't know.

1068
00:45:50,602 --> 00:45:53,397
Our job is to stop the trauma

1069
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,066
and get him into the
ER as soon as possible.

1070
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:02,822
Listen.

1071
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:05,492
The problem at an accident scene

1072
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:07,661
is everyone is so amped
up and full of adrenaline

1073
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:08,996
they get tunnel vision.

1074
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,373
They're just looking
at the one problem.

1075
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:13,416
They're not seeing
the big picture.

1076
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:17,296
Our job, while everyone
else is freaking out,

1077
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:20,215
is to take a deep
breath, step back,

1078
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:22,050
and see the whole thing.

1079
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:27,597
You're right.

1080
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:30,266
-Sorry?
-You're right.

1081
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,104
I didn't think about
that. Thank you.

1082
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:35,230
Uh...

1083
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:37,774
Okay. Uh...

1084
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:40,068
and I shouldn't have questioned
you in front of a patient.

1085
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:41,653
I'm sorry.

1086
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:43,029
It won't happen again.

1087
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,536
Are we good?

1088
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,668
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

1089
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:00,088
Well...

1090
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:11,141
Let's get a burger
before I drop dead.

1091
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:13,018
Did you put that
dipshit in his place?

1092
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:14,185
No.

1093
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:17,105
Because he was right
and I was wrong.

1094
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:20,859
Okay, look. Randy can be an
asshole sometimes, you know?

1095
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,780
Okay, yes, he's a asshole
all the damn time.

1096
00:47:24,863 --> 00:47:27,741
But there's nobody else I
would ride with other than him.

1097
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:29,159
Jesus!

1098
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:30,994
What the hell, man?!

1099
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:32,746
-What are you...
-He's falling apart.

1100
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:34,122
Pedestrians have
the right of way!

1101
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:35,499
You almost killed me, dude!

1102
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:36,917
We all end up like that?

1103
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,877
-Calling yourself a paramedic!
-A broken mess?

1104
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,295
Get out!

1105
00:47:41,504 --> 00:47:42,756
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1106
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,759
Can we go? Please? I'm hungry.

1107
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:47,386
-Okay.
-Alright.

1108
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,221
Let's go feed this motherfucker.

1109
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:15,205
Stop!

1110
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:17,040
-Okay?
-What?

1111
00:48:17,123 --> 00:48:18,375
What you're doing is
fuckin' disgusting.

1112
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,043
-I'm hungry.
-What you mean, you hungry?

1113
00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:21,295
Just puttin' shit in your mouth.

1114
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:23,171
You're eatin' like
a fuckin' Pac-Man.

1115
00:48:23,254 --> 00:48:25,590
You know something? I don't
even wanna eat no more.

1116
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:28,593
You just... I done lost my
appetite watchin' you eat.

1117
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:30,262
Pretty soon, I'm
starting this job,

1118
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:32,014
I'm gonna have a
real lunch hour.

1119
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:35,267
One hour every single day.

1120
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,685
I'm gonna work nine to five.

1121
00:48:36,768 --> 00:48:38,478
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna sleep.

1122
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:40,188
Hey.

1123
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:42,857
Excuse me. Um, are you
an ambulance driver?

1124
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,485
-Paramedic.
-Okay. Wait.

1125
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:47,446
Can I just ask you one question?

1126
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:49,698
Okay. Can I just have
like ten more minutes

1127
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:51,408
and then I'll answer
whatever question you have.

1128
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,826
Wait, just one
thing. Super quick.

1129
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:55,537
What's the worst thing
that you've ever seen?

1130
00:48:58,164 --> 00:49:00,250
Why do people
always ask me that?

1131
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,211
I mean, I get that there's
a morbid fascination,

1132
00:49:03,294 --> 00:49:06,339
but I mean, why do
they ask me that?

1133
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:09,551
What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to <i>you?</i>

1134
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:11,094
You want to think
about that right now?

1135
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:12,179
I sure don't.

1136
00:49:12,262 --> 00:49:15,057
I have seen some
terrible things.

1137
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,226
I know things that you
do not want to know.

1138
00:49:21,062 --> 00:49:23,940
I know what brains smell like.

1139
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:27,194
Brains have a distinct
smell. Did you know that?

1140
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,404
Sometimes I smell it when
I come out of the ambulance

1141
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:32,699
and I know right then and
there, better watch my step

1142
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:36,953
or else I'll slip and fall in
some poor dead soul's memories.

1143
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,959
You know what's in there?

1144
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,504
Dead two-year-old.

1145
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:49,424
She got decapitated by
the seat belt upon impact.

1146
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:51,134
Wanna look in there?

1147
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:53,303
You want that image
seared into your brain

1148
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:54,680
forever and ever?

1149
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:56,890
Well, someone's
gotta look inside.

1150
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:00,477
Someone's gotta have that image

1151
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,854
in their brain for the
rest of their lives.

1152
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:05,231
I'm that somebody.

1153
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:08,235
That's not even the
worst thing I've seen.

1154
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,529
So we get a call,
unknown medical,

1155
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,032
neighbor's complaining
about smells.

1156
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,368
Go into the apartment,
meet the woman,

1157
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,078
she seems totally normal,

1158
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:21,456
but apparently she's suffering
from postpartum depression.

1159
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:23,375
So I ask her,
"Where's the baby?"

1160
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,418
"Where is the baby?"

1161
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,922
Sure enough, there it
is, in the microwave.

1162
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,591
-Stop.
-And its face...

1163
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:33,552
was like melted cheese.

1164
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,804
Oh my God.

1165
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:38,348
That is the worst thing
I've ever heard in my life.

1166
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:41,852
I know! I ordered
it medium rare!

1167
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:45,147
Ah, come on!

1168
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,731
-What the fuck?
-Come on!

1169
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,485
Hey, come on.
Don't be like that.

1170
00:50:50,568 --> 00:50:51,903
You wanted to know.

1171
00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:53,988
You don't want your
chicken sandwich?

1172
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:57,826
You gonna finish that?

1173
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:00,745
Okay, so, there wasn't actually
a baby in the microwave.

1174
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:09,963
See, that's what it is.
You still new to all this.

1175
00:51:10,046 --> 00:51:11,882
And you ain't seen shit yet.

1176
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:13,967
Like, nothing. Not at all.

1177
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,719
You still got all that
resilience in you.

1178
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:18,639
You got the emotional
reserves in the bank.

1179
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,140
You got all that in there.

1180
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:21,224
And when bad shit happen,

1181
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:23,268
you still got that
cushion inside.

1182
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,313
Yeah, but when you been
doin' this long enough...

1183
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:30,275
...you run out of
those reserves.

1184
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:33,153
Yeah, but you keep doing it.

1185
00:51:33,236 --> 00:51:35,113
Aw, hell no.

1186
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:37,198
Shit, I'm goin' to law
school in six months.

1187
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:39,701
-What?
-Yeah.

1188
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:41,911
Why law school?

1189
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,831
You know who gets
fucked over more

1190
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:46,958
than anybody in this country?

1191
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,627
Hardworking people.

1192
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,006
Hardworking people.

1193
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:55,383
My mom.

1194
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:00,597
She, uh, passed two
years ago of-of cancer.

1195
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:05,518
And two years before that,
she went to the hospital

1196
00:52:05,977 --> 00:52:07,938
'cause she knew
something was wrong.

1197
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:09,981
You know, and they
checked her out.

1198
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:12,359
Her insurance covered that.

1199
00:52:13,693 --> 00:52:16,112
They diagnosed her, and
her insurance covered that.

1200
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:22,202
But when it came to
actually helping her...

1201
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:26,081
they told her she didn't
have the right policy.

1202
00:52:26,164 --> 00:52:28,583
She did her best. She was
calling the insurance company

1203
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:31,544
and... arguing and
fighting and...

1204
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,757
But as she was doing
that, the cancer spread.

1205
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:41,221
And she died.

1206
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:45,267
Wasn't even about the
doctors at that point.

1207
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,851
She needed a lawyer.

1208
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:51,064
Look, I wanna help people.
That's why I became EMS.

1209
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:54,693
You know? I want to
make a difference.

1210
00:52:57,362 --> 00:52:59,406
And I don't feel like
that's what we doin', man.

1211
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,828
Also, I...

1212
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,998
would love to not make
minimum wage anymore.

1213
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:10,208
I'm broke as fuck.

1214
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,585
I'm taking all this shit
home and warm it up later.

1215
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:14,629
I don't have a goddamn thing.

1216
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:37,069
{\an8}Well, you know,
it's nighttime now,

1217
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:40,071
{\an8}so it's 'bout to
get <i>really</i> weird.

1218
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,116
-Weird.
-Weird how?

1219
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,786
<i>Medic 42, respond to
A143 Orange Avenue</i>

1220
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:46,995
<i>for a psychiatric patient.</i>

1221
00:53:47,078 --> 00:53:48,997
Shit, man. It's the president.

1222
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:57,381
I'm the president of
the United States!

1223
00:53:57,464 --> 00:53:59,383
Ah! Shit! He hit me in my nuts!

1224
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:01,468
Mike! Help! Mike!

1225
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:03,595
Get your hands off my
friend, motherfucker!

1226
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:05,222
Mike!

1227
00:54:05,305 --> 00:54:06,890
Ah!

1228
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,808
Hit him with something!

1229
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,063
Not fruit! Don't
hit him with fruit!

1230
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:14,690
Call another ambulance!

1231
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:16,858
Charlie, we're trying
to fucking help you!

1232
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,943
-Stop it!
-I'm the president!

1233
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:22,030
I'm the president of
the United States!

1234
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,741
This is what
happened last time.

1235
00:54:24,824 --> 00:54:28,120
So that is why we gotta get
him in the ambulance peacefully

1236
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:30,414
or he will kick the
living shit out of us.

1237
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:33,041
He sounds like he needs to
be in a psychiatric facility.

1238
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:35,794
No, no, no, no, no. Look,
he's a sweetheart, man.

1239
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:37,754
He don't mean any
harm, you know?

1240
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:40,549
That's usually when
he's on his meds.

1241
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:43,510
Now, if he's off his meds,
it's a different story.

1242
00:54:43,593 --> 00:54:44,720
Plus it's the end of the month.

1243
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:46,638
What happens at the
end of the month?

1244
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,975
Look, the system give him
20 pills a month, right?

1245
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:51,601
But there's 30 days in a month.

1246
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,730
What do you think Charlie do
with those other ten days?

1247
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,481
Loses his shit.

1248
00:54:57,232 --> 00:54:59,109
Sometimes he makes it
to the end of the month,

1249
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:00,402
sometimes he don't.

1250
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:01,778
Right now look like he didn't.

1251
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:03,947
So we're not calling PD?

1252
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,659
-No.
-No.

1253
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:11,121
"Look, look, look. Charlie
is a 6'6" Black man

1254
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:13,081
with mental health issues.

1255
00:55:13,164 --> 00:55:14,541
Would you call the police?

1256
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:26,970
Hey, Mike, kill the lights.

1257
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,264
We don't wanna set him off
any more than he already is.

1258
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:35,311
I'm the president of
the United States!

1259
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:41,902
I hate the end of the month.

1260
00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:48,908
Wait, wait, wait.

1261
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:51,787
Hey.

1262
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,331
-You have all your teeth?
-Yeah.

1263
00:55:54,414 --> 00:55:56,541
Then you're gonna wanna stay
about, oh, I don't know...

1264
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:58,126
-Oh.
-...that far back.

1265
00:55:58,209 --> 00:55:59,377
Alright. Alright.

1266
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:00,962
Alright, look.

1267
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:03,215
-Y'all ready?
-Ready.

1268
00:56:03,298 --> 00:56:04,841
Okay, I'm 'bout to knock.

1269
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:12,224
Secret Service!

1270
00:56:12,307 --> 00:56:13,725
Shit.

1271
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:16,478
Uh, h-hey, Mr. President.

1272
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:18,438
Look, look, um... The
Secret Service, man.

1273
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:20,732
We here to evacuate you and
take you to the White House.

1274
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,402
What about the first lady
and the vice president?

1275
00:56:27,781 --> 00:56:29,449
We're gonna send
a second chopper.

1276
00:56:29,532 --> 00:56:30,409
Mm-hmm.

1277
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:31,952
We're not leaving anyone behind.

1278
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:33,287
-Okay.
-Okay?

1279
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,746
-Top secret.
-Top secret, so lay low.

1280
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,039
Come. Sir.

1281
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:38,083
-Come on.
-Please. Please. Come. Come.

1282
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:40,084
Come on.

1283
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:44,672
Stay low. Stay low.
Watch for snipers, sir.

1284
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:47,926
Right this way,
sir. Right this way.

1285
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,220
-Here we go.
-No.

1286
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:52,973
-No.
-It's the chopper.

1287
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,891
Hey, show him that it's
the chopper. Like...

1288
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:56,852
The chopper's right here, sir.

1289
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:02,858
Right this way.

1290
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,277
Come on, man. You got
this. Come on. It's good.

1291
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,029
Alright, we got
Mr. President with us.

1292
00:57:07,112 --> 00:57:09,322
Come on, sir.

1293
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,453
Shit.

1294
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,288
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-No. Hey. Hey.

1295
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:17,748
Officers. Excuse me.

1296
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:20,792
Uh, hey, we've got this
totally under control, okay?

1297
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,544
This is, uh, a patient of ours.

1298
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:23,920
He's having an
episode right now.

1299
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:25,422
There's really, uh...

1300
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:26,840
-Calm down.
-No reason to panic.

1301
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:27,841
Just relax.

1302
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:29,885
We just came here to
help. We got a call.

1303
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,053
Just back up.

1304
00:57:31,136 --> 00:57:32,721
If you could please
turn off your lights.

1305
00:57:32,804 --> 00:57:35,015
-We got a call...
-Got a psychiatric patient.

1306
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,975
The lights are gonna
make him really nervous.

1307
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,769
Calm down, alright?

1308
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:41,313
-I'm the president.
-I know you are. You are.

1309
00:57:41,396 --> 00:57:43,023
I'm the president of
the United States.

1310
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,233
-We're just here to help.
-He's having an episode.

1311
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:47,444
Just back up. Back it up! Now.

1312
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,112
Listen. But you gotta chill.

1313
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:50,364
Just relax, okay? We got you.

1314
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:51,865
-I'm the president.
-I know.

1315
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:53,492
-But you gotta stay calm.
-I'm the president!

1316
00:57:53,575 --> 00:57:54,952
-Please.
-I'm the president!

1317
00:57:55,035 --> 00:57:56,495
-Calm down!
-I'm the president!

1318
00:57:56,578 --> 00:57:57,955
I'm the president of
the United States!

1319
00:57:58,038 --> 00:57:59,373
-Whoa!
-No, no, no, no, no!

1320
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,211
-I'm the president!
-Hey, chill! Chill! Chill!

1321
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:05,545
Calm him down.

1322
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:07,339
No. Please. You do
not have to do this.

1323
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:08,715
-Ma'am, back up.
-Okay.

1324
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:10,258
Please, you've gotta
put the guns down!

1325
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:12,010
He's not a danger!

1326
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:14,137
-I'm the president!
-Now!

1327
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,472
-Now!
-Come on!

1328
00:58:15,555 --> 00:58:18,225
-I'm the president!
-Calm him down, or I will!

1329
00:58:18,308 --> 00:58:20,519
-I will! Okay. Okay.
-Right now! Or we will.

1330
00:58:20,602 --> 00:58:22,062
-Okay, let me...
-Right now!

1331
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,481
Hey. Hey. Hey. Calm down.

1332
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:26,108
Look at me. Look at me.

1333
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:28,527
Look at me. Calm... You
gotta calm down, man.

1334
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,946
Please, please calm down for me.

1335
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:32,864
Okay?

1336
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:35,992
Please calm down. They
don't give a fuck, man.

1337
00:58:37,202 --> 00:58:38,996
But I give a fuck, okay?

1338
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:40,830
Hey, hey, Mr. President.

1339
00:58:42,457 --> 00:58:43,750
Charlie.

1340
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:46,795
I see you, okay?

1341
00:58:48,546 --> 00:58:50,215
I see you and I got you.

1342
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:54,177
But you gotta calm down, okay?

1343
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:57,514
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1344
00:58:57,597 --> 00:58:59,432
I won't let nothin'
happen to you.

1345
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:02,644
Just calm down. Okay?

1346
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:05,355
Okay. Okay.

1347
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:06,438
Hey...

1348
00:59:08,316 --> 00:59:10,235
As you can see, he's
calmed down, okay?

1349
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:12,946
I'm EMS.

1350
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:15,073
That's our ambulance
right there. We got him.

1351
00:59:15,156 --> 00:59:17,617
Okay? He's just havin'
an episode today.

1352
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:19,703
Alright?

1353
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:21,830
Just put the guns down, alright?

1354
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:25,875
Please.

1355
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:30,421
Okay.

1356
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:32,799
Alright.

1357
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,428
Hey. Hey! Look at me.

1358
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:38,722
I'm proud of you, man.

1359
00:59:42,142 --> 00:59:43,142
Thank you.

1360
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,062
Thank you.

1361
00:59:47,355 --> 00:59:48,357
I'm good.

1362
00:59:58,616 --> 01:00:00,994
-This way.
-Everything's fine, okay?

1363
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:03,246
Just have a seat.

1364
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:05,791
She's gonna belt you in, okay?

1365
01:00:05,874 --> 01:00:09,002
We can't take off until we
get you belted in, okay?

1366
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:45,705
I'm the president of
the United States!

1367
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:48,625
I'm the president of
the United States!

1368
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,050
I'm the president of
the United States!

1369
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,136
I can't fuckin' do the IV!

1370
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:01,138
-Okay, I got it. Just breathe.
-I can't get it!

1371
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:03,098
I'm the president of
the United States!

1372
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,228
I'm the president of
the United States!

1373
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:11,857
Randy, can you do me a
favor and maybe, um...

1374
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,276
maybe keep the president
calm for a little bit?

1375
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:16,778
Yeah, I'm on it.

1376
01:01:17,737 --> 01:01:20,616
County ER, it's, uh, Medic 42.

1377
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:22,325
Can I get a physician on?

1378
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,870
<i>Copy. Standby.</i>

1379
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:27,122
I need a doctor's permission
to administer a sedative.

1380
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:28,582
<i>This is Dr. Serano. What?</i>

1381
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:31,710
Uh, yeah, Dr. Serano,
this is Paramedic Randy.

1382
01:01:31,793 --> 01:01:34,087
Uh, currently en route
to your facility,

1383
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,340
and an emergent
psychiatric patient.

1384
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:38,759
Patient was
uncontrollable at scene

1385
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:41,178
and actively fighting
the restraints.

1386
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:43,138
Uh, blood pressure 172 over 100.

1387
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:46,224
Seeking two milligrams
of atropine for sedation.

1388
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,143
-Wait.
<i>-Atropine?</i>

1389
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:49,770
Yeah, for sedation. Yes.

1390
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:51,396
<i>Atropine?</i>

1391
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:53,649
<i>Do you mean Ativan?</i>

1392
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:56,484
<i>Are you trying to kill your
patient, Paramedic Randy?</i>

1393
01:01:57,068 --> 01:01:58,403
Fuck!

1394
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,322
Ativan. Yes, Ativan.

1395
01:02:00,405 --> 01:02:02,324
Two milligrams for sedation.

1396
01:02:02,407 --> 01:02:05,035
Uh, ETA ten minutes.

1397
01:02:05,118 --> 01:02:06,453
<i>Wonderful.</i>

1398
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:08,622
<i>Try not to murder
anyone on the way.</i>

1399
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:09,957
Fuck.

1400
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,292
It had to be Serano. Fuck!

1401
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:29,601
Shit! You scared me.

1402
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:31,311
Oh, please.

1403
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:32,937
Give me a fuckin' break.

1404
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:36,817
Hey. You know, there are three
other hospitals in this area.

1405
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,694
Why don't you drop your
patients in one of them, huh?

1406
01:02:38,777 --> 01:02:40,821
It's a busy night.
It's not up to me.

1407
01:02:43,031 --> 01:02:46,243
You take care of what,
one patient at a time?

1408
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:49,704
I got 25 full beds
in there, man.

1409
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,832
I got a waiting room
with an eight-hour wait.

1410
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:57,962
I got emergency codes going
off upstairs constantly.

1411
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,467
I got an administration that
won't hire enough staff,

1412
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:05,887
and simultaneously tell me
that I gotta be fuckin' nicer?

1413
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,808
I gotta be nicer and
I gotta be faster.

1414
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:13,061
This whole building is
on <i>my</i> shoulders, man.

1415
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:16,981
And now, now I gotta take
time to fix <i>your</i> mistakes.

1416
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:19,401
Well, I got a better idea.

1417
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:21,361
Maybe you take your
bullshit patients

1418
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:22,987
somewhere the fuck else.

1419
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:27,743
<i>Dr. Serano, come to
emergency, please.</i>

1420
01:03:27,826 --> 01:03:29,745
Well, you'll excuse me.

1421
01:03:29,828 --> 01:03:32,163
I gotta go back to
never being done.

1422
01:03:37,544 --> 01:03:38,795
Alright, here we go.

1423
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:41,131
-Let's go.
-Watch this.

1424
01:03:41,214 --> 01:03:43,216
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Can you handle the heat?

1425
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:45,093
I got it, playboy. Come on, now.

1426
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:47,471
Oh!

1427
01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:52,893
-Whoo!
-Oh, yeah?

1428
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:55,270
-That's not a home run.
-That's a home run, man.

1429
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:57,189
You didn't even make
it to the sidewalk.

1430
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:58,482
Went right over your head.

1431
01:03:58,565 --> 01:04:01,068
The gutter is the home run line.

1432
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:02,986
-That's bullshit.
-Oh, shit. That ain't bullshit.

1433
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:04,237
That's a fuckin' home run.

1434
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,198
-Don't be a hater.
-Go get your ball.

1435
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:08,200
-I'm up.
-No. No. What...

1436
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:10,243
Know something? This is
crazy that this is...

1437
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:13,163
We been doin' this silly
shit for three years now.

1438
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:14,498
You gon' miss me?

1439
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:15,749
Oh...

1440
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:18,043
We're gonna see each
other. We'll hang out.

1441
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:20,295
What you mean? We
don't hang out.

1442
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:22,923
Yeah, we do. What are
we doin' right now?

1443
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:24,508
Dude, this don't
count. We're at work.

1444
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:26,259
-This is fun, it's friendship.
-This is work.

1445
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:28,804
-This is not hanging out.
-This is...

1446
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:30,055
This is EMS shit, man.

1447
01:04:30,138 --> 01:04:31,390
I don't know shit about you.

1448
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:32,975
We don't even talk like that.

1449
01:04:33,058 --> 01:04:34,393
What type of shit
you want me to ask?

1450
01:04:34,476 --> 01:04:36,186
Like, how's your
mom doing? Or...

1451
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:38,021
if your lawn is being tended to.

1452
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:39,940
If you have a lawn.
I don't even know...

1453
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:42,734
My mom is dead and
I don't have a lawn.

1454
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:45,236
And... I don't know. What else?

1455
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:49,491
Goddamn, man. We're
just coworkers, man.

1456
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:51,785
You act like I'm like your
best friend or something.

1457
01:04:54,496 --> 01:04:55,663
Come on.

1458
01:04:56,373 --> 01:04:57,373
Pfft.

1459
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,378
-Oh, shit, I'm your best friend.
-Okay, who's up?

1460
01:05:01,461 --> 01:05:03,130
I have a lot of friends.

1461
01:05:03,213 --> 01:05:04,547
I have a lot of...

1462
01:05:05,298 --> 01:05:09,011
-lot of really... good friends.
<i>-Medic 42, respond.</i>

1463
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:11,471
-Damnit. I'm his best friend.
-Medic 42 responding.

1464
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:13,515
-That sucks.
-You're not my best friend!

1465
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:15,976
-Jerry's my best friend.
-Who's Jerry?

1466
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:18,228
-Who the fuck is Jerry?
-Jerry's my cousin.

1467
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,147
He lives in Tempe.

1468
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:34,703
That's why we don't run.

1469
01:05:41,376 --> 01:05:42,794
Excuse us. Comin' through.

1470
01:05:44,003 --> 01:05:46,131
Excuse us. Thank you.

1471
01:05:51,803 --> 01:05:53,013
What happened?

1472
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,557
Hit with a line drive right
in the chest and passed out.

1473
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,851
-I got it. Thank you.
-Are you his father?

1474
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,353
No.

1475
01:05:59,436 --> 01:06:01,063
Uncle. Uh...

1476
01:06:01,146 --> 01:06:03,941
Uh, do you know if he has
any, uh, medical problems?

1477
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:05,067
Uh, <i>problem as...</i>

1478
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:12,157
Yeah, none that he knows.

1479
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:19,039
Did the AED shock him?

1480
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:20,415
Yeah, twice now.

1481
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:22,459
-Did he wake up at all?
-No.

1482
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:23,626
Let's hold CPR.

1483
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:32,761
Okay, he's in V-fib.

1484
01:06:33,344 --> 01:06:35,055
Charging.

1485
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:36,306
Okay. Clear.

1486
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,308
-Clear.
-Clear.

1487
01:06:39,726 --> 01:06:41,519
Okay, Mike, continue CPR.

1488
01:06:43,563 --> 01:06:45,482
How long was he down
before you started CPR?

1489
01:06:45,565 --> 01:06:47,234
We thought he just had the
wind knocked out of him...

1490
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:49,319
-Yeah, how long exactly?
-I don't know, maybe a minute.

1491
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,904
Okay, that's good enough.

1492
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:54,324
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1493
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:57,326
We have a pulse.

1494
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:03,417
-My chest hurts.
-Oh. Hey-hey, buddy.

1495
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,460
-What's his name?
-Vicente.

1496
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,504
Vicente, hey. My name's Randy,

1497
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,631
and we're gonna be
taking care of you, okay?

1498
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:00,307
Hey, spike that for me?

1499
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,225
Get a blood pressure.

1500
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:03,852
Am I gonna die?

1501
01:08:04,936 --> 01:08:06,188
We're gonna do
everything in our power

1502
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,731
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

1503
01:08:07,814 --> 01:08:09,357
Alright?

1504
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:11,818
My chest hurts.

1505
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:14,279
There's no easy way
to say this, Vicente.

1506
01:08:14,362 --> 01:08:15,988
Your heart got hit
with a baseball

1507
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:18,742
and it stopped. That's
why your chest hurts.

1508
01:08:18,825 --> 01:08:22,162
In the exact millisecond,
your heart got hit

1509
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:23,496
just as it was contracting.

1510
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,916
It's like the ball reached out

1511
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,043
and sucker-punched your heart.

1512
01:08:28,877 --> 01:08:30,420
It's a one-in-a-million chance.

1513
01:08:30,503 --> 01:08:33,715
And as a matter of
fact, after all this,

1514
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:36,426
I would go buy a lottery
ticket if I were you.

1515
01:08:37,843 --> 01:08:40,054
So... am I gonna die?

1516
01:08:40,137 --> 01:08:43,517
You're with us now, and our
job is to keep you healthy.

1517
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,227
Okay? So just lie
there and relax.

1518
01:08:47,812 --> 01:08:49,064
BP's 90 over 60.

1519
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:51,566
Okay. That's not a bad start.

1520
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:52,733
You're gonna feel
a little sting.

1521
01:08:52,816 --> 01:08:54,443
Gonna get an IV started.

1522
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:56,945
One, two, three.

1523
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:58,614
Okay.

1524
01:08:59,908 --> 01:09:02,577
Now... you having any
trouble breathing?

1525
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,872
A little. My chest hurts.

1526
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:08,541
Any pain anywhere else?

1527
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:10,544
No. Not really.

1528
01:09:10,627 --> 01:09:12,461
You have any medical problems?

1529
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:14,840
-No.
-On any meds? Any allergies?

1530
01:09:14,923 --> 01:09:16,383
-No.
-No? Okay.

1531
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,551
-How old are you again?
-Eleven.

1532
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,970
-Are you married?
-What?

1533
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:22,764
-No.
-I get it.

1534
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:25,017
You're not ready to settle.
You wanna play the field.

1535
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,602
You wanna keep
your options open.

1536
01:09:26,685 --> 01:09:28,604
That commitment is scary.

1537
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:30,856
I get it. I'm with
you. Pound it.

1538
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:32,440
Boom.

1539
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:36,486
I'm gonna call the hospital.
You just lie there and relax.

1540
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:39,196
So... am I gonna die?

1541
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:47,163
You're gonna be alright.

1542
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:50,041
Promise.

1543
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:55,964
County ER, Medic 42.

1544
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:58,383
<i>Medic 42, this is
County. Go ahead.</i>

1545
01:09:58,466 --> 01:10:01,678
County, Medic 42 en
route to your facility

1546
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:04,431
emergent with 11-year-old
patient post-cardiac arrest

1547
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:06,391
due to a baseball to the chest.

1548
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:08,393
Patient was down for
approximately a minute

1549
01:10:08,476 --> 01:10:09,770
before receiving CPR.

1550
01:10:09,853 --> 01:10:12,356
Two shocks by AED, one by me.

1551
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:13,857
Patient is in sinus tach.

1552
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,652
Conscious, alert,
oriented times three.

1553
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:18,320
Blood pressure 90 over 60.

1554
01:10:18,403 --> 01:10:20,656
ETA approximately seven minutes.

1555
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:22,407
<i>County copies.</i>

1556
01:10:22,824 --> 01:10:24,367
Medic 42 clear.

1557
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:27,662
Hey, Vicente. So you're quite
the baseball player, huh?

1558
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:30,267
What position do they
have you playing?

1559
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:32,959
My chest...

1560
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:35,963
I feel funny.

1561
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:40,133
Start CPR.

1562
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:44,680
Charging.

1563
01:10:47,348 --> 01:10:48,976
-Clear.
-Clear.

1564
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:50,686
Clear.

1565
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,652
County ER, Medic 42.

1566
01:10:58,735 --> 01:11:00,279
<i>Medic 42, go ahead.</i>

1567
01:11:00,362 --> 01:11:02,781
Patient is back
in cardiac arrest.

1568
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,366
Uh, ETA two minutes.

1569
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:13,417
-What do you need?
-Let's get him outta here.

1570
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,793
-You stay in.
-Comin' out.

1571
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,421
Okay, we're good.

1572
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:20,841
-Comin' through.
-Comin'. Excuse us.

1573
01:11:20,924 --> 01:11:23,218
-Watch out.
-What was his last pressure?

1574
01:11:23,301 --> 01:11:27,097
90 over 60. Pulse 110.
About 20 breaths a minute.

1575
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,474
He was fine and then just
went right back into V-fib.

1576
01:11:29,557 --> 01:11:31,393
Uh, 11-year-old child, male,

1577
01:11:31,476 --> 01:11:33,186
hit in the chest
with a baseball.

1578
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:35,397
Was down for about a minute
before they started CPR.

1579
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,690
Shocked three times,

1580
01:11:36,773 --> 01:11:38,275
became alert and
conscious three times.

1581
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:40,068
Went back into V-fib,
he was defibbed at 200.

1582
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:42,112
One milligram of
epi, shocked again,

1583
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:43,780
second milligram of epi.

1584
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:45,282
He's currently asystolic.

1585
01:11:45,365 --> 01:11:47,159
-Do we have a name?
-Vicente.

1586
01:11:47,242 --> 01:11:49,786
That-that's all we... That's
all we have is Vicente.

1587
01:11:49,869 --> 01:11:52,455
You got half a name? Great work.

1588
01:12:09,764 --> 01:12:10,764
Hey.

1589
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:14,185
Thought you'd wanna know.
Your patient didn't make it.

1590
01:12:17,814 --> 01:12:19,107
Thanks, Colette.

1591
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:23,695
Yeah, that sucks.

1592
01:12:25,155 --> 01:12:26,823
You were great
with him, Randy.

1593
01:12:31,745 --> 01:12:33,080
No, I wasn't.

1594
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:34,873
Yeah... You were.

1595
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,083
You didn't make
a single mistake.

1596
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,167
It's not your fault.

1597
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,710
You did nothing wrong.

1598
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,211
I made a big fucking mistake.

1599
01:12:41,838 --> 01:12:43,965
I told a boy he was
gonna live and he died.

1600
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:46,927
It's a rookie fucking
move, and I knew better.

1601
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,846
But Goddamnit, he just kept...

1602
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:52,766
asking... ...and asking.

1603
01:12:56,061 --> 01:12:57,187
That boy died...

1604
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:59,731
thinking I was gonna save him.

1605
01:13:01,024 --> 01:13:03,276
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

1606
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:05,988
And that's...

1607
01:13:06,071 --> 01:13:07,489
why we build a wall.

1608
01:13:07,572 --> 01:13:08,657
Not to keep people out

1609
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,409
but to keep shit
like that inside.

1610
01:13:32,347 --> 01:13:34,140
This job breaks everybody.

1611
01:13:41,356 --> 01:13:43,317
<i>All we wanna do
is save your life.</i>

1612
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,569
Oh! Shit!

1613
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:50,073
<i>Some of you...</i>

1614
01:13:50,156 --> 01:13:51,950
<i>don't make it easy.</i>

1615
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:56,747
<i>You should be dead
five times over...</i>

1616
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,127
<i>...but no matter how many times</i>

1617
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:03,753
<i>you brush with death...</i>

1618
01:14:05,755 --> 01:14:07,632
<i>you refuse to die.</i>

1619
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:09,967
<i>Respect.</i>

1620
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:14,389
<i>Others of you, we do
everything right...</i>

1621
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:17,225
<i>...and you die on us anyway.</i>

1622
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:18,518
What the fuck?

1623
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:20,395
<i>We see you struggling.</i>

1624
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:23,023
<i>They can't deny you service...</i>

1625
01:14:23,106 --> 01:14:24,775
<i>but they can bankrupt you.</i>

1626
01:14:24,858 --> 01:14:27,110
-Wait. Who had the blister?
-She did.

1627
01:14:27,193 --> 01:14:28,362
You? Okay.

1628
01:14:28,445 --> 01:14:31,031
<i>We carry you on our backs,</i>

1629
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:33,158
<i>every one of us,</i>

1630
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:36,662
<i>and you crush us a
little more every day</i>

1631
01:14:36,745 --> 01:14:39,664
<i>until you grind
us down to a nub.</i>

1632
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:43,418
This is all part of the job,

1633
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,836
so you deal with it.

1634
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,005
You compartmentalize it.

1635
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:49,675
You eat shit and shove
it down, down, down,

1636
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:52,219
until one day you
wake up and you say,

1637
01:14:52,302 --> 01:14:53,178
you know what?

1638
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:57,640
Fuck the patients.

1639
01:14:59,601 --> 01:15:00,894
Fuck the nurses.

1640
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:03,730
Fuck the doctors.

1641
01:15:06,107 --> 01:15:08,526
Fuck this ratty-ass hospital!

1642
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:13,865
Fuck all the blood
and shit and puke.

1643
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,786
Fuck your documentation!

1644
01:15:18,453 --> 01:15:20,122
Fuck the fakers.

1645
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:22,124
Fuck the bullshit calls.

1646
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:23,875
Fuck every shoplifter
who got caught

1647
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:25,668
and pretended to pass out.

1648
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,463
Ah! Ah!

1649
01:15:28,546 --> 01:15:29,923
-Come on.
-Get up.

1650
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:32,050
Fuck the fire department.

1651
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:33,844
Fuck the PD.

1652
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:36,305
I know my rights.
I know my rights!

1653
01:15:36,388 --> 01:15:39,516
Fuck every 2:00 a.m. drunk
who think they know the law.

1654
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:43,061
Fuck the bystanders,
the rubberneckers,

1655
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:45,063
the lookie-loos.

1656
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:49,234
Fuck the dead ones.

1657
01:15:49,693 --> 01:15:50,694
Fuck the live ones.

1658
01:15:50,777 --> 01:15:52,446
Fuck this bullshit pay.

1659
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:54,573
Fuck me! Fuck you!

1660
01:15:54,656 --> 01:15:56,533
Fuck this job!

1661
01:15:58,076 --> 01:15:59,703
Fuck everyone,

1662
01:15:59,786 --> 01:16:02,664
except the kid who just
wanted to play baseball.

1663
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,752
Exit paperwork.

1664
01:16:08,503 --> 01:16:09,796
You don't have to sign it.

1665
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,729
-I'm goin' home.
-Randy...

1666
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:27,939
Please don't go out like this.

1667
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:32,610
Just leaving without even
finishing your last shift?

1668
01:16:34,112 --> 01:16:35,947
Don't go out like a chump.

1669
01:17:09,022 --> 01:17:10,690
Mike, turn on the lights.

1670
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:14,527
Randy, come on, now. You...

1671
01:17:15,987 --> 01:17:17,948
You know I can't do that
unless we get a call.

1672
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:19,491
Come on, man.

1673
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:25,831
Alright.

1674
01:17:25,914 --> 01:17:27,874
One last time.

1675
01:17:46,101 --> 01:17:48,728
<i>Medic 42, emergency traffic.</i>

1676
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:51,481
-You gonna answer that?
-No.

1677
01:17:51,564 --> 01:17:53,358
Let another crew
handle it. Just...

1678
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:55,402
You know what? Drop
me off at home.

1679
01:17:55,485 --> 01:17:57,863
What? Motherfucker, I
don't know where you live.

1680
01:17:57,946 --> 01:18:00,532
<i>Medic 42, respond.</i>

more and you're done.

Hey, what the hell?!

01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:08,266
Alright, you grab the
stuff. I'll check this out.

1686
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:11,395
-What the hell?!
-I got you!

1687
01:19:11,478 --> 01:19:14,189
Where's PD to control
these assholes?

1688
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,323
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

{\an8}That's not good.

1691
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,086
Fuck.

1692
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:47,263
All dead in here.

1693
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,558
Watch your step.

1694
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:07,784
She's got a pulse.

1695
01:20:07,867 --> 01:20:09,411
She's breathing.

1696
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:10,954
Shallow and ragged.

1697
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,622
-Hold C-spine.
-Okay.

1698
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:21,757
Okay. Let's roll her on three.

1699
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,134
One, two, three.

1700
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:49,117
Grab the collar.
Keep her breathing.

1701
01:21:01,713 --> 01:21:02,756
Oh, lucky...

1702
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,759
lucky baby.

1703
01:21:05,842 --> 01:21:08,303
How'd you get so lucky? Huh?

1704
01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:09,972
Okay.

1705
01:21:10,055 --> 01:21:12,891
It's okay.

1706
01:21:12,974 --> 01:21:15,852
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Oh!

1707
01:21:15,935 --> 01:21:17,646
You're a lucky baby.

1708
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,502
Stop that car! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1709
01:21:40,585 --> 01:21:42,212
-Hey! Heads up! Heads up!
-Oh! Move!

1710
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:44,381
Move!

1711
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,674
Hey! Hey!

1712
01:21:45,757 --> 01:21:48,260
You almost killed us, asshole!

1713
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:54,099
Hey, Jimmy. Take your truck,
park it perpendicular,

1714
01:21:54,182 --> 01:21:56,268
-block that ramp.
-Hold on. Wait. What?

1715
01:21:56,351 --> 01:21:58,186
Block off the whole
fuckin' freeway!

1716
01:21:58,269 --> 01:22:01,023
No one gets through!

1717
01:22:01,106 --> 01:22:02,274
Oh, shit.

1718
01:22:07,821 --> 01:22:10,824
County, Medic 42. Do you
have another unit incoming?

1719
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:12,534
<i>Negative.</i>

<i>Next available
unit is 15 minutes.</i>

<i>Want us to start a second unit?</i>

1722
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:17,997
Negative. We're taking
the baby with us.

1723
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:35,766
-Good lung sounds.
-Good.

1724
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:37,517
A crying baby is a healthy baby.

1725
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,186
Alright, switch with me.

1726
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:40,312
Your job is airway.

1727
01:22:40,395 --> 01:22:42,814
Keep her breathing at all costs.

1728
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:44,441
Let's see if she takes an OPA.

1729
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,778
Yeah, she took
it. No gag reflex.

1730
01:22:47,861 --> 01:22:50,572
Mom's got a lot of rib
fractures and head lacs.

1731
01:22:50,655 --> 01:22:53,075
Oh, she's gagging on the
OPA, but it's intermittent.

1732
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,035
-Should I take it out?
-Yeah, take it out.

1733
01:22:55,118 --> 01:22:56,870
She's had too much
trauma already.

1734
01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:00,040
Talk to her. See if
she can obey commands.

1735
01:23:01,124 --> 01:23:03,835
Miss, can you raise
your right arm, please?

1736
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:08,382
Alright, not bad.
Hang on there, Mom.

1737
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,133
Ma'am, you're in an ambulance.

1738
01:23:10,216 --> 01:23:12,678
You were in a pretty bad wreck.
We have your child. She's okay.

1739
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:14,221
We're taking you
to the hospital.

1740
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,847
County ER, this is Medic 42.

1741
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:18,058
Incoming to your facility,
emergent with two patients.

1742
01:23:18,141 --> 01:23:20,727
One a Level I, the other
a stable pediatric.

1743
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,729
<i>Medic 42, be aware,
we're on diversion.</i>

1744
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:24,231
<i>We've got way too
many patients here.</i>

1745
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:26,108
<i>You'll have to take them
to the ER at University.</i>

1746
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:27,985
Uh, negative. Negative.

1747
01:23:28,068 --> 01:23:29,903
She will not make
it to University.

1748
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:32,823
Listen up. Got an approximately
30-year-old female,

1749
01:23:32,906 --> 01:23:36,285
a head-on collision, ejection,
massive damage to vehicle.

1750
01:23:36,368 --> 01:23:38,495
<i>What's their GCS?</i>

1751
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:40,872
Well, right now
it's a 14, but...

1752
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:43,166
<i>Your patient doesn't
meet Level I criteria.</i>

1753
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:44,376
Yes, she does!

1754
01:23:44,459 --> 01:23:46,461
We're gonna be there
in five minutes,

1755
01:23:46,544 --> 01:23:47,879
so just page out a team.

1756
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:49,339
<i>Negative, we are on diversion.</i>

1757
01:23:49,422 --> 01:23:50,799
<i>Do not come here, understand?</i>

1758
01:23:50,882 --> 01:23:52,467
<i>You need to reroute
to a different ER.</i>

1759
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,303
We are coming there
whether you like it or not!

1760
01:23:54,386 --> 01:23:55,512
So get ready for us!

1761
01:24:06,856 --> 01:24:08,108
-Hey, Astor?
-Yeah?

1762
01:24:08,191 --> 01:24:09,318
-Wanna take that baby?
-Got it.

1763
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:10,819
Meet us inside?

1764
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:13,280
Medic 42. What bay?

1765
01:24:13,363 --> 01:24:14,781
Two. But they're not happy.

1766
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:16,450
Serano's on the warpath.

1767
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:18,076
No one is happy.

1768
01:24:19,536 --> 01:24:21,747
No. No. No.

1769
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,665
-Stop.
-No, no, no. Doctor, listen.

1770
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,334
-This is a 30-something...
-No!

1771
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,002
-A head-on collision.
-No. No. No.

1772
01:24:27,085 --> 01:24:28,462
The four other
passengers are DOA.

1773
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:30,172
She is not a Level I criteria.

1774
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:33,675
Do you have any idea how
expensive a Level I criteria is?

1775
01:24:33,758 --> 01:24:35,427
Any idea, you idiot?

1776
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,346
Okay! This patient meets
all Level I criteria.

1777
01:24:37,429 --> 01:24:38,972
She's not even intubated!

1778
01:24:39,055 --> 01:24:41,058
You got her bagged?
What the hell is that?

1779
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:43,560
This patient is dying, asshole!

1780
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,228
-Now listen to my report!
-Asshole?

1781
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:46,855
How 'bout fuck you, asshole!

1782
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:49,066
-Come on! Come on!
-Shit.

1783
01:24:49,149 --> 01:24:52,277
I will be happy to kick your ass
and put you in a bed next to her

1784
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,779
but you need to
listen to my report!

1785
01:24:53,862 --> 01:24:56,448
How 'bout this? Instead
I call your supervisor,

1786
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,366
we settle this right now.

1787
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,369
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1788
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,290
Excuse me?

1789
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,543
-Who are you?
-This patient just went apneic

1790
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:10,963
three times with no gag reflex
on the way to the hospital.

1791
01:25:11,046 --> 01:25:12,089
She's got a skull fracture.

1792
01:25:12,172 --> 01:25:13,674
She meets all Level I criteria.

1793
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:15,217
Because last time I checked,

1794
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,302
when a patient goes
apneic with no gag,

1795
01:25:17,385 --> 01:25:20,180
their GCS goes down
to three. Right?

1796
01:25:20,263 --> 01:25:22,557
And I just watched this
paramedic fight like hell

1797
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,893
to save this woman's life
while caring for her child

1798
01:25:24,976 --> 01:25:27,729
and dodging incoming traffic
at the same fucking time!

1799
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:30,023
And all I see you doing
is standing there,

1800
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:32,734
like a fucking asshole,
with your dick in your hand,

1801
01:25:32,817 --> 01:25:34,820
arguing with him
about this patient

1802
01:25:34,903 --> 01:25:35,904
who is dying!

1803
01:25:35,987 --> 01:25:37,781
<i>Your</i> patient!

1804
01:25:39,908 --> 01:25:41,326
And if you refuse to treat her,

1805
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:43,244
you'll lose your
goddamn license.

1806
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,333
Who are you?

1807
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:52,796
I'm Dr. Romero. I'm
your new resident.

1808
01:25:55,298 --> 01:25:56,591
Oh, shit.

1809
01:26:00,678 --> 01:26:04,015
Well, Dr. Romero...

1810
01:26:06,184 --> 01:26:07,811
I look forward to
working with you.

1811
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:11,189
We're gonna have so much fun.

1812
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:13,692
Get the patient.

1813
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:21,158
O-Okay, look.

1814
01:26:21,241 --> 01:26:24,244
You mean to tell
me you're a doctor?

1815
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:27,997
Resident, but yeah.

1816
01:26:28,581 --> 01:26:30,417
But you told us you
were a paramedic.

1817
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,628
No, I-I didn't. You said that.

1818
01:26:32,711 --> 01:26:34,254
I just didn't correct you.

1819
01:26:34,879 --> 01:26:36,798
Um... I never said that.

1820
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:39,760
You... That's what you
said when we first met you.

1821
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:42,721
No. Why would I? I'm a
doctor, not a paramedic.

1822
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:45,140
Hey, Dr. What's-your-face.

1823
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:47,517
Grab a bedpan and come with me.

1824
01:26:49,561 --> 01:26:51,438
We're gonna have <i>so</i> much fun!

1825
01:26:54,566 --> 01:26:57,110
-Hmm.
-Whoa.

1826
01:26:58,486 --> 01:26:59,863
That's, uh...

1827
01:27:01,322 --> 01:27:02,782
Huh.

1828
01:27:09,706 --> 01:27:10,791
Hey.

1829
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:13,835
Patient's gonna live.

1830
01:27:15,003 --> 01:27:16,838
I mean, usually
once we drop 'em off

1831
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:19,132
it's not our problem
anymore. But, um...

1832
01:27:20,008 --> 01:27:21,802
But it's good to, um,

1833
01:27:21,885 --> 01:27:24,054
it's good to know she-she
made it, you know?

1834
01:27:24,721 --> 01:27:26,014
Yeah.

1835
01:27:27,432 --> 01:27:29,267
Way to, uh, throw
yourself under the bus...

1836
01:27:30,018 --> 01:27:31,270
doctor.

1837
01:27:31,353 --> 01:27:33,897
Serano's gonna make
your life a living hell.

1838
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,524
I know.

1839
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:37,859
I never wanna be
that kind of surgeon.

1840
01:27:40,028 --> 01:27:41,613
Thanks for the coffee, doc.

1841
01:27:57,879 --> 01:27:59,172
She should have died.

1842
01:28:00,715 --> 01:28:02,425
She would have died in my care.

1843
01:28:04,803 --> 01:28:07,764
Right now, I'd be telling that
family that their mom is dead.

1844
01:28:12,894 --> 01:28:14,563
You know, I thought
I'd come out here today

1845
01:28:14,646 --> 01:28:16,439
and I'd meet the
paramedics and...

1846
01:28:17,357 --> 01:28:19,859
see what you do, how you work.

1847
01:28:23,405 --> 01:28:25,073
And I know you're
sick of your job.

1848
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,200
I know you're burnt out.

1849
01:28:27,283 --> 01:28:29,369
I know you think you
don't make a difference.

1850
01:28:31,162 --> 01:28:32,789
But you made a difference today.

1851
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,166
You did.

1852
01:28:36,626 --> 01:28:38,253
You saved her life.

1853
01:28:40,672 --> 01:28:42,298
And you saved her family.

1854
01:28:47,262 --> 01:28:49,222
You're the kind of
doctor I want to be.

1855
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,310
Not a doctor.

1856
01:28:55,478 --> 01:28:56,563
Well...

1857
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,274
if I ever need saving...

1858
01:29:01,443 --> 01:29:03,486
God, I hope it's
you that shows up.

1859
01:29:35,435 --> 01:29:37,020
Hey, one of those is for Mike.

1860
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:41,524
Not anymore.

1861
01:30:16,393 --> 01:30:17,853
That is a gift from the crews.

1862
01:30:17,936 --> 01:30:19,396
This is breakfast, on us.

1863
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:21,023
Dispatch and the crews
chipped in after they heard

1864
01:30:21,106 --> 01:30:22,941
you told Dr. Serano
to go fuck himself.

1865
01:30:23,024 --> 01:30:25,443
So this is a retirement gift.

1866
01:30:26,653 --> 01:30:27,653
Wow.

1867
01:30:28,697 --> 01:30:29,697
Come on.

1868
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,492
Aw.

1869
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:36,371
Now, get out of my
substation, civilian.

1870
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:04,399
Keep your password safe.

1871
01:31:05,066 --> 01:31:07,194
If you have any trouble at
all, call IT right away.

1872
01:31:07,277 --> 01:31:10,364
If you have any trouble with
them, call me right away.

1873
01:31:10,447 --> 01:31:11,782
Okay.

1874
01:31:11,865 --> 01:31:13,784
Alright. Uh, now, to access

1875
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:16,203
the forms for the
preauthorization...

1876
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:25,378
You guys ever see
anyone choke to death?

1877
01:31:26,046 --> 01:31:27,839
You get the fist like
right under here,

1878
01:31:27,922 --> 01:31:30,050
and then it's just
straight back.

1879
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:31,843
Ha!

1880
01:31:34,345 --> 01:31:36,264
Drowning's the worst way to go.

1881
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:37,808
Absolute worst way to go.

1882
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:39,100
Best way to die?

1883
01:31:40,018 --> 01:31:41,311
Decapitation.

1884
01:31:52,822 --> 01:31:54,449
What are you still doin' here?

1885
01:31:55,742 --> 01:31:57,535
Oh. Is that it?

1886
01:31:59,621 --> 01:32:00,497
That's it.

1887
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:01,748
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1888
01:32:01,831 --> 01:32:02,999
Uh...

1889
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:12,235
Hi.

1890
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:17,282
So...

1891
01:33:17,365 --> 01:33:20,744
Well, as it turns out...

1892
01:33:20,827 --> 01:33:24,205
your close-out paperwork
was never properly...

1893
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:26,416
filed.

1894
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:33,506
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

1895
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:36,843
Hey, uh, maybe I could...

1896
01:33:36,926 --> 01:33:38,386
thank you properly sometime.

1897
01:33:39,596 --> 01:33:40,638
Take you out for lunch.

1898
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,310
Alright.

1899
01:33:49,022 --> 01:33:52,317
And, uh, you will be in
truck 42 with Mike today.

1900
01:33:55,236 --> 01:33:57,781
Hey, Randy!

1901
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:10,585
That's right. That's right.

1902
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:12,129
Listen, man. Uh...

1903
01:34:12,212 --> 01:34:14,089
You gotta let me drive this one.

1904
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:15,299
-Nope.
-Mike.

1905
01:34:15,382 --> 01:34:17,259
Not a chance. You
know the rules.

1906
01:34:17,342 --> 01:34:18,968
Okay? I wheel, you heal.

1907
01:34:19,761 --> 01:34:22,222
Come on, now.
Ain't shit changed.

1908
01:34:22,305 --> 01:34:25,100
"Let me drive this one."

1909
01:34:26,142 --> 01:34:27,603
Yeah, the system
is still broken,

1910
01:34:27,686 --> 01:34:29,979
but what am I supposed
to do, quit trying?

1911
01:34:31,356 --> 01:34:32,816
I'm no hero.

1912
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,652
But... the truth is...

1913
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:38,947
I only feel alive when
you're about to die.

1914
01:34:44,619 --> 01:34:46,371
