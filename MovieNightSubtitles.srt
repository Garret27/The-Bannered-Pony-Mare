My dad did.

547
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:03,840
He shot her, and then he shot
himself. That’s why they’re both dead.

548

- It’s okay.

y’all. Good evening.

- WAITRESS: All right.

553

medium rare. No fries.

554
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:26,380

tender salad, charbroiled.

570
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:15,118

plain, nothing on it.

612
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:37,088
I won’t let anything stop me
from accomplishing this goal.

613
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:41,609
I’ve been training for this competition
every moment of my entire life.

614
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:44,095
2016 Grand Prix, Dayton, Ohio,

615
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,924
judge told me I
had small deltoids,

616
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,615
said they needed work.

617
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:48,972
So what’d I do? I worked
them day and night

618
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:50,411
until they were perfect.

619
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:53,104
No sport on Earth
requires as much time,

620
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:55,313
energy, and commitment.

621
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:58,109
24 hours a day. There’s no days
off. There’s no missing meals.

622
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:00,594
There’s no missing sleep.
There’s no missing workouts.

623
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,390
You can’t do this
at 90%, or even 99%.

624
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:06,220
Take it from me. If you’re not
100%, you will never be successful.

625
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:09,637
You gotta burn the boats and bridges,
and commit all energy and focus

626
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:11,985
to being the greatest
bodybuilder on the entire planet.

627
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:15,574
The body is not used to the ninth
or tenth or 11th or 12th rep.

628
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:20,959
No, you’ve gotta go through this
pain barrier, and just go on and on.

629
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:23,824
And it’s these last two,
three or four repetitions,

630
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:26,102
that’s what makes
the muscle grow,

631
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,771
and that’s what separates one from
being a champion and not being one.

632
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:31,625
This is what most people lack, the
guts to just go in there and say,

633
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:36,837
"I don’t care what happens.
If I fall, I have no fear."
