3
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,124
We have apprehended

4
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,624
a dangerous threat
in one of our very own labs.

5
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,458
Quiet!

6
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:07,624
We believe that this...
this monstrosity...

7
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:14,541
...is the product of illegal
genetic experimentation.

8
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,707
What deranged lunatic would
create something like this?

9
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,915
I prefer "deranged genius,"

10
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,165
but thank you
for the introduction.

11
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,665
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,
you were tasked

12
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,374
with safely studying
biological threats,

13
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,332
not creating them.

14
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,665
A threat?

15
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,457
Experiment 626...

16
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,374
...is our federation's
most sophisticated weapon.

17
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,000
626 is unstoppable.

18
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,040
Indestructible.

19
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:52,666
And smarter
than 100 supercomputers.

20
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,625
I don't wanna play anymore!

21
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,707
It's an atrocity!

22
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,332
- Destroy it!
- I can't even look at him.

23
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,874
He should be exiled.

24
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,582
Silence!

25
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,457
He did not ask to be created.

26
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,165
Perhaps, if he is
so intelligent,

27
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,665
he has the capacity to reason.

28
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,957
Experiment 626, show us

29
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,332
that there is something
inside you

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,916
that is good.

31
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,041
So naughty.

32
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,499
Throwing up. Throwing up.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,707
I did not teach him that.

34
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,624
You have made
our decision easy.

35
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,832
He is clearly the flawed
product of a deranged mind.

36
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,082
Dr. Jookiba,
your lab will be destroyed.

37
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,707
Okay. Just leave me 626.

38
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,165
And 626 exiled.

39
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,707
Oh, come on!

40
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,957
- Bailiff.
- Wait.

41
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,874
No, no, no, no!
You can't do that.

42
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,208
No!

43
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,583
Huh?

44
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,624
Don't get any ideas.

45
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,291
These guns are locked on
your genetic signature.

46
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,790
They're not gonna shoot anyone
but you.

47
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,916
Hmm. Oh.

48
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,707
Knock it off! Federation
strictly forbids being gross.

49
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,040
Don't make me say it-- Ew!

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,041
Uh-oh.

51
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
Where is he?

52
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,458
He's loose on Deck C.

53
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,582
Now heading for the hull.

54
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,665
What?

55
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,082
He's trying
to find the police...

56
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,582
...cruisers.

57
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,082
He, uh... He took the red one.

58
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,625
Fire at will!

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,290
He's in hyperspace.

60
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,040
Where will he exit?

61
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,707
In 12 hours,
we project he will collide

62
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,374
with a planet called "E-arth."

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,832
That's a planet full of water.

64
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,041
Water increases
his molecular density.

65
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,582
Uh...

66
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,207
He'll become heavy and drown.

67
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,374
Oh!

68
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,041
So I think we can all say
farewell to 62...

69
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,000
You're kidding.

70
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,624
Oh, what a pickle
we've got here!

71
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,582
If only there was
a brilliant genius around

72
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,165
to help you catch
that monster.

73
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,832
You! You're the reason
we're in this mess.

74
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,332
And I could get you out of it.

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,999
If you release me
and give me back my lab.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,624
Nonsense. We'll simply
vaporize the planet. Captain.

77
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,415
Armed and ready,
Councilwoman.

78
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,915
Hold it! Hold everything!

79
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,499
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,665
You can't destroy the planet!

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,790
Aw, man.

82
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,124
Uh, who's this?

83
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,707
Agent Pleakley.
Earth expert at your service.

84
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,790
Howdy.

85
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,999
"Earth expert"?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,624
I'm an expert in that planet's
flora, fauna and fashion.

87
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,040
Yeah, this outfit
screams "expert."

88
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,790
Yeah. I'm researching
an Earth species

89
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,290
that's half-cow and half-boy.

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,207
- It's quite fascinating--
- Yes, marvelous.

91
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,582
What's your point?

92
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,790
Oh, uh, Earth is
a protected wildlife reserve.

93
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,332
We've been using it to rebuild
the mosquito population.

94
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,332
Crikey. Very well.

95
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,999
Dr. Jookiba, you will travel
to Earth, where you will

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,290
capture the escaped
lab experiment known as 626.

97
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,915
Agent Pleakley,
you will be going with him.

98
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,457
You are deputized to ensure
he follows Federation rules.

99
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,290
What?
I don't need a babysitter.

100
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,999
This is all very dangerous,
and it's likely you'll die.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,082
Do you accept?

102
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,957
With every heart in my body,
of course I accept!

103
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,374
I'm going to Earth!
Hey, everyone!

104
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,499
- If I may...
- Thank you, thank you.

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,707
- Can I hug you?
- No.

106
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,249
- Can I hug--
- No.

107
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,707
Sorry. Permission to hug
the Grand Councilwoman?

108
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,040
- That's not going to happen.
- Of course. My apologies.

109
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,290
I do not need supervision.
You have asked...

110
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,665
Permission to hug
my new partner?

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,957
Brilliant. Permission granted.

112
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,083
So what I'm just trying
to say is, I--

113
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,749
It would just be better
if I went by myself.

114
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,790
Do not let the Earthlings
discover your mission,

115
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,457
or I will be forced
to intervene.

116
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,707
This is a dream vacay.

117
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,040
I have so much packing to do!

118
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,374
Well, well, well, 626.

119
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:27,500
What hideous, pathetic planet
is caught in your crosshairs?

120
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,165
Let's go snorkeling later.

121
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,290
Yeah, that's a great idea.

122
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,000
I know, right? So cool.
They have the best sandwiches.

123
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,832
Are you supposed to be here?

124
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,625
I'm in town
for the convention.

125
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,625
Cool.

126
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,207
You're free! Go, go!
Live your lives!

127
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,374
No, no, no! No! Lilo.

128
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,749
Not again.

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,832
They deserve to be free!

130
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,915
Lilo!

131
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,291
I'm gonna have to talk
to Nani about this.

132
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,000
Sorry!
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,666
Hey, Jimmy's Luau.
Hey, brother.

134
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,458
- Go, go. Hurry.
- Sorry.

135
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,125
Hey. You're gonna be late.

136
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,041
Yeah.

137
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,207
Where is she?
She's always late.

138
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,833
Has anyone seen Lilo?

139
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,249
Lilo, thank goodness.

140
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,832
I thought you were gonna
be on time today.

141
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,790
I had to get a sandwich
for Pudge.

142
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,790
Is Pudge a friend in need?

143
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,874
He's a fish.
I forgot to tell you that.

144
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,249
So, you're late because
you fed a sandwich to a fish?

145
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,165
Yeah.
Pudge controls the weather.

146
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,541
She's so weird.

147
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,415
Lilo, honey, come on.

148
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,500
Get dressed, honey.

149
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,290
Oh, guys, look.

150
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,040
I got
a friendship bracelet too.

151
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,624
That's not
a friendship bracelet.

152
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,499
Ew, garbage girl
puts garbage on her arm.

153
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,249
Girls, hÄmau. HoÊ»omÄkaukau.

154
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,707
Come on.

155
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,082
You know, silly,

156
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,165
it's not a friendship bracelet
if you don't have any friends.

157
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,124
Girls, girls, girls.
Hui! Kulikuli.

158
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
Stand in line. Get ready.

159
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,416
No, no, no.

160
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,541
Okay, not today.

161
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,666
She's not coming.

162
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,290
- Kumu!
- Who's her parents?

163
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,958
Girls, go.

164
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,915
She acts up all the time.

165
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,499
Somebody
needs to look after her.

166
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,540
She's always causing trouble.

167
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,499
She's just not a good fit.

168
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,665
Kumu, where is her sister?
That's the real question here.

169
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,957
It's a delicate
home situation for Lilo.

170
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,749
She's not a bad kid.
She just needs--

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,040
I don't know, Kumu.

172
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,124
I just don't know.

173
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,499
She disrupts the class

174
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
and ruined
today's performance.

175
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,665
â™ª Well, since my baby left me â™ª

176
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,625
â™ª Well, I've found a new place
To dwell â™ª

177
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,165
â™ª Well, it's down at the end
Of Lonely Street â™ª

178
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,915
â™ª At Heartbreak Hotel â™ª

179
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,333
â™ª I'll be so lonely, baby â™ª

180
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,624
â™ª I'll be so lonely... â™ª

181
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,082
Lilo? Can you please
open the door?

182
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,583
Read the note!

183
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,624
I'm sorry I missed
your performance.

184
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,374
- PÄpÄ's truck died.
- Blah, blah. Wow!

185
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,499
That must be
so stressful for you.

186
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,250
How about you just
leave me alone to die?

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,790
No, no, no. Not now, not now.

188
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,415
The social worker is here.
You can pout later, Lilo.

189
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,499
That's not how pouting works.

190
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,832
Lilo, open the door.

191
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,457
I can't hear you.
It's really weird.

192
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,000
Open the door
or I'm breaking it down!

193
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,707
Hey, what is wrong with you?

194
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,707
Uh...

195
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,040
Mrs. Kekoa.

196
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,250
Hi. Um, nice to see you.

197
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,124
Can I, uh, help you
carry anything in?

198
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,290
I'm okay.

199
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,790
Can I help you
carry anything in?

200
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,540
Oh, yeah. Would you mind
if we just, um,

201
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,874
just use the back?
It's just, uh, just right--

202
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,375
We're in the back.

203
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,916
These old houses, right?

204
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,374
You just gotta have the...
the touch!

205
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,166
Oh! Oh...

206
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,582
There we go! Um... Actually,

207
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,540
would you mind waiting here
for just a second?

208
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,583
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

209
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,582
- Hey! Don't touch that.
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

210
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,124
- That's mine.
- I'm turning it off right now.

211
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,249
So, uh, what can I
get you to drink?

212
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,749
Do you have tea?

213
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,875
Course I have...

214
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,083
There's a lot
of unpaid bills here, Nani.

215
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,415
How often would you say

216
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,915
you leave your little sister
home alone?

217
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,040
What? No. I... No.

218
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,082
Why would I do that? I...

219
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,000
I would never leave
my sister alone.

220
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,625
Smoke, Nani!

221
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,540
- Oh! Oh, uh...
- The alarm! The smoke alarm!

222
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,499
Oh, don't worry.
There's no batteries in there.

223
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,790
Lilo!

224
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,290
I took 'em out
because it kept going off.

225
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,875
That's not true.

226
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,583
Say aloha to Mrs. Kekoa.

227
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,457
Aloha, Lilo. How are you?

228
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,000
Is that blood?

229
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,957
Oh, yeah, I've been practicing
jumping out of my window.

230
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,625
Ha! She's... She's kidding.

231
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,207
She's actually been
very well behaved recently.

232
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,624
Haven't you, right?

233
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,749
Yeah,

234
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,790
I've been more than good,
Mrs. Kekoa.

235
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:36,207
I've been doing very,
very great at hula.

236
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,790
Made a ton
of new friends there,

237
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,249
and they all think
I'm the coolest.

238
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,875
I've been eating
a lot of organic stuff.

239
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,082
Sometimes I eat too much.

240
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:54,957
And I've been eating
five or ten times a day.

241
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,582
Sometimes I eat so much, I...

242
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,791
can't...

243
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,082
breathe.

244
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,374
That's enough imagination
for you, you little weirdie.

245
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,750
Oh, tea's ready.

246
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,541
Hmm. Okay, pretty sweet.

247
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,625
Okay, Nani, we both know
this didn't go well today.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,499
I can see you're trying,

249
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,416
but you're too smart for me
to beat around the bush here.

250
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,832
I know it hasn't
been that long

251
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,458
since your parents
passed away,

252
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,582
but my job is to make sure

253
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,625
that Lilo is in
a stable environment.

254
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
And I can't say that
in good conscience right now.

255
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,082
Listen, I know this is a lot.

256
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,499
You're practically
a kid yourself.

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,999
What happened
to knocking?

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,665
We decided
it was a surf day!

259
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,500
A surf day?

260
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,625
Look, you seem like
a goal-oriented person.

261
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,457
We have a new director coming
into town next week,

262
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,290
and I would really,
really love to tell him

263
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,290
that you girls
have turned the corner.

264
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,790
So, why don't we come up with
some goals to achieve by then?

265
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,208
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,958
All right, here.

267
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,666
Three things.

268
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,040
First, I want this house
cleaned, including laundry,

269
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,999
- and a fully-stocked fridge.
- Perfect.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,083
Second, pay all those bills
I saw in the kitchen.

271
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,874
Yes.

272
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,415
And third,
file for health insurance

273
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,707
for you and Lilo.

274
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,165
Got it.

275
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,290
If you do those three things
by Friday,

276
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,833
I might be able
to give you some more time.

277
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,250
Thank you.

278
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,750
Okay.

279
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,125
It was Capri Sun, yeah?

280
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,916
- Yeah.
- I figured.

281
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,707
And
don't forget the insurance.

282
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,457
Yeah, yeah. You got it.

283
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,790
You're gonna need
that health insurance

284
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,041
for when I kill you!

285
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,624
Oh, yeah.

286
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,415
We took out
the smoke alarm batteries.

287
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,457
I'll show you "can't breathe."
Come here!

288
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,166
- Let go of me!
- Yeah, no.

289
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,082
Ow. Okay.

290
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,249
No, no, no.

291
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,790
Why didn't you wait at hula?

292
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,249
Because you weren't there.

293
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,415
Do you want them
to split us up?

294
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,624
Because that's what's
gonna happen

295
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,333
if we don't get it together.

296
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,749
Hey! Did you just lick me?

297
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,374
Stop pretending you're my mom.

298
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,499
Oh. At least I don't tell
the social worker

299
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,665
I like jumping out of windows.

300
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,665
It's better
than listening to you.

301
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,832
Go to your room!

302
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,666
I'm already in my room!

303
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,082
Hey, Alvin.

304
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,250
There she is, Miss Aloha.

305
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,915
Yeah, not today she's not.

306
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,333
Meeting never go well.

307
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,665
I never liked
that government lady anyway.

308
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,540
Why is she always so smiley?
Give me the creeps.

309
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,249
Yeah, well,
our future is in her hands.

310
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,790
Ah, ah. None of that.

311
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,957
Your future is in your hands.

312
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,707
And you're gonna have
a very bright future

313
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,250
'cause of that
akamai brain of yours.

314
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,790
What?

315
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,874
Your acceptance letter
to your dream school

316
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,999
magically taken
out of your trash

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,082
and appearing in your bag
at your place of work?

318
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,957
Ooh, that's a sign, girl.

319
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,124
Will you stop with this?

320
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,832
That school is the best school
in the whole world

321
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,582
for that bionic magnets.

322
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,290
Bio... Marine biology.

323
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,000
Marine biology.

324
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,374
And they already
let you in once,

325
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,249
and they wanted
to give you for full ride.

326
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,499
Yeah, I know, but, TÅ«tÅ«,
there's no way.

327
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,790
Lilo needs me here.

328
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,833
You ever ask Lilo
what she wants?

329
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,040
She's six, so, no.

330
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,082
Sorry, TÅ«tÅ«.
Had to catch a few extra ones.

331
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,499
The swell was... Hey, Nani!

332
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,624
What are you doing here?

333
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,832
I live here.

334
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,249
We're neighbors.

335
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,166
Yeah. Yeah,
that's... that's good. Uh...

336
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,999
The waves were crazy today.

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,457
You know, I was like,
"Nani should be here,"

338
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,790
'cause you're always, like,
shredding waves,

339
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,082
and I miss shredding you.

340
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,665
I mean, I miss...

341
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,290
I miss seeing you
shred waves, so...

342
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,207
Yeah.

343
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,499
I've always loved
watching you.

344
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458
- Not to say that--
- Well said, David.

345
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,957
- Well.
- So, like, when...

346
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,457
when are you gonna go surfing?

347
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,291
Maybe when Lilo turns 18.

348
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,916
Enjoy the surf.

349
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,832
Bebeh.

350
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,749
Now, make up
with your sister, yeah?

351
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,957
You need anything,
you just ask, okay?

352
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,999
We're not just neighbors,
you know.

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,208
We're Ê»ohana.

354
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,832
- Yeah, I mean, if you want--
- No, no!

355
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,333
No, David, you've said enough.

356
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,332
Warning.

357
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,332
- Check engine.
- Hmm?

358
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,374
Warning. Check engine.

359
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,125
Warning. Guidan--

360
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,665
Guidance not functional.

361
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,083
Warning. Guidance not
functional. Warning.

362
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,666
Warning.
Guidance not functional.

363
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,874
Crash imminent.
Prepare for impact.

364
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,583
Hey. Think I might've nailed
those kalua sliders you like.

365
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,958
Here.

366
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,583
You don't have to eat it.

367
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,833
Nani, am I bad?

368
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,624
What?

369
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,500
That's what everyone says.

370
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,541
Nobody says that.

371
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,458
Maybe some teachers

372
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,958
and school security guards.

373
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,291
Look, you're not bad.

374
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,749
You just do
bad things sometimes.

375
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,041
Just like me earlier,
when I yelled at you.

376
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,958
We just have to learn
from our mistakes.

377
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,040
I shoved Mertle Edmonds today.

378
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,457
I know.

379
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,250
You wanna tell me
what happened?

380
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,999
People treat me different.

381
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,708
Baby, they just...

382
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,500
They just don't know
what to say.

383
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,707
But you...

384
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,166
you didn't mean what you said,

385
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,665
did you?

386
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,958
No. Of course not.

387
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,250
You're my sister.

388
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,750
And I'll always be here
for you. Okay?

389
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,416
You got that?

390
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,749
No more tickle town.

391
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,290
Yes, tickle town.
Yes, tickle town.

392
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,457
- Tickle town!
- I don't wanna go!

393
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,040
Will you still
be able to visit

394
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,207
when you join the Marines?

395
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,124
It's not the Marines.

396
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,874
It's marine biology.

397
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,499
Anyway, it's not
gonna happen anymore.

398
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm staying right here.

399
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,500
Remember when we put up
those constellations?

400
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,708
The Three Sisters.

401
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,249
That one's you. That's me.

402
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,333
And that one means,
"time for bed."

403
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,958
I like you better
as a sister than a mom.

404
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,500
Ouch.

405
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,500
A shooting star!

406
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,749
Oh, my gosh.
I have to make a wish.

407
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,999
You, out!

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,665
- What? Why? Whoa.
- Out!

409
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,249
You can't be here.
It won't come true.

410
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,707
Gravity is increasing.

411
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,208
- No, it's not, sister.
- Oh.

412
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,499
I wish a wish upon a star,
even though it's very far.

413
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,415
I hope and pray, hope it might
send me my wish tonight.

414
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,999
All I wish is a friend.
A real friend.

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,999
Someone who won't tease me.

416
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,999
Someone who won't run away.

417
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,375
Like a best friend.

418
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,374
Send me an angel.

419
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,499
The nicest one you have.

420
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,958
Please.

421
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,333
Huh?

422
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,833
Huh. What does this thing do?

423
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,582
Give me that back! You're
not authorized to touch that.

424
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,665
Why? Does it eject you
from the ship? That'd be nice.

425
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,040
It's connected
to his tracking collar.

426
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,665
That's never gonna work.

427
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,249
You might as well
give him a mood ring.

428
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,499
That collar tells us exactly
where he is at all times.

429
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,540
And that's why
our mission cannot fail.

430
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,832
Mission failed.

431
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,957
Oh, no!

432
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,999
You know, I am right so often,
I don't even enjoy it anymore.

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,999
The novelty
has completely worn off.

434
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,458
Whoo-hoo!

435
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,915
Mmm.

436
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,540
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

437
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,082
Will you relax?
I know his every move.

438
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,832
Yeehaw!

439
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,708
What the hell?

440
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,833
Hmm.

441
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,540
Huh?

442
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,750
- I saw it over there.
- Where did it go?

443
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,125
Huh?

444
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,665
How are we gonna find him?

445
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,874
We just have to follow
the path of destruction.

446
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:43,958
I got him!

447
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,250
It talked to me!

448
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,082
Huh? Ah!

449
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,750
Ooh!

450
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,083
There.

451
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,874
Jumba! No,
you can't fly this close!

452
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,291
- Seat belts, please.
- Or else--

453
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,166
The humans will see us.

454
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,624
You're jeopardizing
the mission.

455
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,040
- We can't be seen.
- I'm in charge now.

456
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,666
Partners are supposed
to share.

457
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,915
Oh!

458
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,832
It's called "vacation."

459
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,499
Once every solar year,
the human migrates

460
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,749
to go see a sunlight
and drink celebratory poison.

461
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,874
What are we doing here?
We've gotta find 626.

462
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,790
We will, after we blend in.

463
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:57,957
How are we gonna do that?

464
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,582
With these. And this.

465
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,457
It's a Federation-certified
cloning device.

466
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,458
What? Who are we gonna clone?

467
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,457
Ugh, this is never gonna work.

468
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,208
Just be cool and normal.

469
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,249
They look like a bunch

470
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,708
of Slim Jims with googly eyes.

471
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,624
No, not those two.

472
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,165
Look at their
disgusting Popsicle bodies.

473
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,082
Human, what a downgrade.

474
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,624
Look at these two.

475
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,749
They look like best friends
just like us.

476
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,958
They're perfect.

477
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,790
I'm so sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

478
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm so sorry.
Here, I will hold you up.

479
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,999
Apologies.
What a nice arm you have.

480
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,999
Okay. Are you guys--

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,291
And I thank you.

482
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,624
I feel like
I'm walking on chopsticks.

483
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,415
My legs feel a little wobbly.

484
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,874
I know.
Don't worry. They're fine.

485
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,207
You watched
the video I sent you, right?

486
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,124
The walking video?

487
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,832
Yeah, but I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

488
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,125
One foot
in front of the other.

489
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,291
Cool and normal.

490
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,290
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

491
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,165
- How are you?
- I'm good. Thank you.

492
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,124
- I would like to check in.
- Okay.

493
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,915
So, how many nights
will you be staying with us?

494
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,415
I don't want to stay with you.

495
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,957
I would like my own room
with a door.

496
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,875
Oh, and a hot tube.
I would like a hot tube.

497
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Uh, a hot tub?

498
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,665
Yes, that's how you say it...

499
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,290
- ...down here.
- Okay.

500
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,291
And where are
you visiting us from?

501
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:20,958
- Earth.
- Earth.

502
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,291
We both grew up in Earth.

503
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,082
Earth. Okay,
that should be about it.

504
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,124
Marcus, could you help him
with his bags please?

505
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,250
Yes.

506
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,208
What is it?

507
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,208
Gotta be some kind
of a dog, right?

508
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,791
What kind of dog
has six legs, bro?

509
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,582
Oh, nice. That went
better than I expected.

510
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,208
Which part, falling
down? It was embarrassing.

511
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,083
Hangers.

512
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,333
Humans.

513
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,790
Disgusting.

514
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,082
They're really
simple creatures.

515
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,915
Every time an asteroid hits,
they start life all over.

516
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,583
It's quite adorable, actually.

517
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,707
You know what I'd really
like to do while we're here?

518
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,582
Sneeze. Humans do this thing

519
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,665
where they blast juice
out of their nose.

520
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,124
What are you doing?

521
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,957
I'm finding him.
We only have 48 hours.

522
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,415
Wait! No! Wait, wait, wait.

523
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,457
Humans have never seen
a portal before.

524
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,582
The Grand Councilwoman
was very clear

525
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,333
not to draw attention
to ourselves!

526
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,083
What about that guy?

527
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,499
Listen,

528
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,707
I majored in Earth studies
and minored in human textiles.

529
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,540
- Wow!
- Trust me.

530
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,625
We need to blend in.

531
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,290
Fourth floor, please.

532
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,541
Can you stop that?

533
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,832
Aloha, I'm Stephanie Lum.

534
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,249
Breaking news on a
strange situation last night.

535
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,207
A local tour bus ran over
an unidentified wild animal

536
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,582
who terrorized a wedding.

537
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:08,082
The creature is recovering at
the NÄ Mea Ola Animal Rescue.

538
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,832
- More on that at 10:00...
- Bingo.

539
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,500
...and hear from
the wedding photographer.

540
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,124
TÅ«tÅ«, can I go
into the animal shelter?

541
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,790
Please, please, please.

542
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,624
Nani lets me do it.

543
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,415
Okay. But no wander.

544
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,082
I'll pick you
after I pau shopping, okay?

545
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,583
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

546
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,665
If anyone tries anything,
hit 'em in the eyes with this.

547
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,207
Whoa! Cool!

548
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,249
Ho ho.

549
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,374
Whoa. Okay.

550
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:04,375
Uh, no, no.

551
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,291
Can I pet
the dogs again?

552
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,832
- Hi, AJ.
- Okay.

553
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,250
But you know you can't feed
the dogs candy again, right?

554
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,666
Lilo.

555
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,374
But it makes them happy.

556
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,166
It makes them have diarrhea.

557
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,416
Hmm?

558
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,083
Huh?

559
00:30:58,958 --> 00:30:59,958
Huh?

560
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,124
Nighty night, 626.

561
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,208
Jumba?

562
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,041
Will you please stay still?

563
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,582
Ow.

564
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,207
I'm gonna get an earful for
these ferns we trampled on.

565
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,165
Not to mention if we actually
hurt any of the humans,

566
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,999
- then we're really-- What?
- Quiet.

567
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,540
He's listening out for us.

568
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,958
Who's listening?

569
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,707
Oh. How good's his hearing?

570
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:30,999
That's really good!

571
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,457
Yeah,
they're called super ears.

572
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,749
Yeehaw!

573
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,166
Huh.

574
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,332
Hey, Bailey.

575
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,750
Look who's back.

576
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,041
What's the matter?
Is it bath day today?

577
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,707
Man, the mood in here
is very depressing.

578
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,665
Sorry, guys.
AJ took all my candy.

579
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,499
Are you guys okay?

580
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,915
The Grand
Councilwoman was very clear.

581
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,957
I know the rules.

582
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,582
I know I could catch
him if I used my blaster.

583
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,874
It's too risky.

584
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,582
The Grand Councilwoman
was very clear.

585
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,415
You can't hurt the humans.

586
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:03,708
Whoa. This one
must've been a good one.

587
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,708
Huh?

588
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,250
Um...

589
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,707
Hi.

590
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,458
Whoa.

591
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:29,458
Um...

592
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,540
AuÄ“, what is that?

593
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,207
A dog, I think.

594
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,249
Looks like some
kind of baby bear

595
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,499
that come out of the trash.

596
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,707
I like him. Come here, boy.

597
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,915
Yeah,
let's put this one back, Lilo.

598
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,165
- Come here.
- Sweetie.

599
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,499
You know, we do have
better dogs. Like, way better.

600
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,790
Not better than him.
He can talk.

601
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,875
Say, "aloha."

602
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,540
- Alo--
- Dogs no can talk.

603
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,875
Dogs can't talk, Lilo.

604
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,207
Nah,
we can come back later.

605
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,666
You sure you like this one?

606
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,125
Yep.

607
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,083
He's perfect.

608
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,290
Oh,
look at that genius.

609
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,290
He's using the mini human
as a shield.

610
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,457
Got you.

611
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,791
Wait, you can't shoot!

612
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:31,915
That's your fault.

613
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,541
What?

614
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,791
An animal?
What were you thinking?

615
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,457
- Was it her idea?
- No.

616
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,874
- She just said...
- Did she put you up to this?

617
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,165
Uh...

618
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:56,374
You have to be polite.
You're our guest!

619
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,665
- It was my idea.
- What?

620
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,291
TÅ«tÅ«, are you kidding me?
Why on earth would you...

621
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,000
It's been hard
for that girl, no?

622
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,166
Hey, take that off him.

623
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,958
And for you too.

624
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,290
And a pet might bring joy.

625
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,582
Remember,
we don't hurt chickens, okay?

626
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,500
Like me and Alvin.

627
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,040
I forgot I'm covering
Maya's shift today at work.

628
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,624
Lilo, I need you two
to keep yourselves busy, okay?

629
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,374
I've gotta clean the house
before work.

630
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,457
Are we gonna keep him?

631
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,249
- Ah! Just today.
- Yeah!

632
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,582
But we are taking it back
first thing tomorrow morning.

633
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,707
And, hey, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

634
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,332
He is your kuleana, okay?
Your responsibility.

635
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,999
You have to be a big girl
about this. Got it?

636
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,375
We promise.

637
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:56,124
Special Agent Cobra Bubbles,

638
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,082
there's no sign of a pilot.

639
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,874
No tracks. No trails.

640
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,332
Nothing since the incident.

641
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,750
Who says it walked?

642
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,166
Sir?

643
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,041
Sir, you're not implying
this is extraterrestrial?

644
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,415
- Hmm...
- Sir,

645
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,707
second team intercepted this
from a nearby dog shelter.

646
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,790
You were right.

647
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,708
I'm sorry. Sir,
what division are you from?

648
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,749
When things fall
out of the sky,

649
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,124
you're the public's
first line of defense.

650
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,833
I'm the last. Often the only.

651
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,499
I need to find out what kind
of threat we're dealing with.

652
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:36,708
Okay, just stay put.
I'll be back in a second.

653
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,665
Hey, Mertle, look,
I got a new dog.

654
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,749
Oh, no, not Lilo.

655
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,165
That's the weirdest thing.

656
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,999
Just like you.

657
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,707
Hey, give that back!

658
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,041
Give that back!
Stop it!

659
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,540
- Lilo plays with dolls.
- Be careful with her!

660
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,249
Lilo,
what is up with your dog?

661
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,291
What is up with you?

662
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,040
Wait for me.

663
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,790
Why are you doing that? Lilo!

664
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,458
I don't know.
Blame it all on him.

665
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,083
What are you doing?

666
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,625
Ah-ha!

667
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,541
How long
does this thing last anyway?

668
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,458
Isn't that them?

669
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,207
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

670
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,624
He'll stop at nothing
to get away from us.

671
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,665
He will likely head
for a big city

672
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,458
for maximum destruction.

673
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,541
But he's gonna
find out real soon,

674
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,915
- he's stuck here.
- Huh?

675
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,291
Don't you love being on
an island with no big cities?

676
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:54,124
It's just miles and miles
of water.

677
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,540
Come on. I'm gonna take
you to my favorite spots.

678
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,290
You're gonna love it.

679
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,416
Come on. Come in the water
with me. It's so fun.

680
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,416
It's just water.

681
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,750
Ready? Fetch.

682
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,708
Come on. Animals like water.

683
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,708
Oh, so
you like trouble, huh?

684
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:43,958
Come on, boy.

685
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,958
Lilo, we can see you.

686
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,166
You know
you shouldn't be here.

687
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,957
Go, go, go.

688
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,707
Get down. Get down from there.

689
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,333
- Oh, my God. Control him.
- I'm trying.

690
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,125
Ah, no.

691
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,207
Did he just...

692
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,958
No.

693
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,833
No. Stop.

694
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,958
Did he just--

695
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,790
Great, Lilo.
Now I have to stitch that up.

696
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,165
What? What? What? What?

697
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,540
That's his name. Stitch!

698
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,040
Lilo, you can't
just do that, okay?

699
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,499
Seriously. I thought
I almost hit something.

700
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,583
Huh?

701
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,333
Oh, I...

702
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,915
I am so, so sorry.

703
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,250
Is... Is... Are...
Are you guys okay? I...

704
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,040
Lilo, lock your door.

705
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,416
Was he dragging another
man across the street?

706
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,541
Nah-nah. He-he.

707
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,374
See you later.

708
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,540
Get over yourself.
Just give me a second.

709
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,457
Okay. Come on. Come on.

710
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,208
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

711
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,750
Why do I have to
be at your work?

712
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,457
I'm six.

713
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,250
Because someone
got kicked out of hula.

714
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,707
Stay here.

715
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,457
It's so boring here.

716
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,624
And no dogs on the table.

717
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,457
- Why not?
- Because people eat off them.

718
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,499
Nani.

719
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,249
Who cares? They're already
covered with bird poo.

720
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,750
Lilo.

721
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,625
Nani!

722
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,040
Come on.

723
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,166
Stay here.

724
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,957
We don't have time for you to
babysit your little daughter.

725
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,165
No, no, it's fine. It won't
happen again. I promise.

726
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,916
I'll go get the table.

727
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,582
Hey, Lilo. How's it going?

728
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,708
Look, David, I got a dog.

729
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,290
You sure that's a dog?

730
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,374
Mmm. Yeah.

731
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,291
Mmm.

732
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,665
Um, hey.

733
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,665
You know, your sister.

734
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:49,790
Have you noticed she's been
a little tense recently?

735
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,874
Don't worry.
She's always like that.

736
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,915
But she said that she likes
your butt and fancy hair.

737
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,124
She told you that?

738
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:59,000
Nope.
But I read her text messages.

739
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:00,791
Oh.

740
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,415
Okay. Uh...

741
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,374
Stitch? Oop.

742
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,541
Stitch?

743
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,499
There you are.

744
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
We have to stay at the table.

745
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:15,457
Stitch.

746
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,082
No.

747
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:22,000
Stitch, put it down.

748
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,999
Yes.

749
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,749
- You.
- No, no, no.

750
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,499
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

751
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,207
And then...

752
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,624
- No.
- Ah.

753
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,625
I'm gonna give you
to the count of three, Stitch.

754
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,416
One.

755
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,791
Ah-ha!

756
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,749
Wait!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

757
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,040
Hey, get back to work.

758
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,665
Cake! Cake!

759
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,915
Are you guys staying
out of trouble?

760
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,332
Yeah. Of course.

761
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,500
You hungry, boy?

762
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,000
Stitch?

763
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,250
- Stitch!
- Hey!

764
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,750
Fire!

765
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,250
I wish it could've worked out.

766
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,375
Not right now, Stitch.

767
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,375
Here you go.

768
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:07,165
626, you little scoundrel.
What a piece of work you are.

769
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:10,125
Hello, human. Fellow human.
Hello, hello. Ooh, look, fire.

770
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,249
Look, look, look. We're close.

771
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,415
Wait, it's moving.
Come on. Come on.

772
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:16,249
Let's go. We gotta go.

773
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,165
Oh. Oh, look,
it's Grand Councilwoman.

774
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:20,082
- Don't answer that. Not now.
- It's Grand Councilwoman.

775
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,499
Your Majesty.

776
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,124
Aren't you just
looking delightful today?

777
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,540
It has been 24 hours. Have you
captured the creature?

778
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:27,749
Start.

779
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,624
Start traveling, please.

780
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,124
We've captured his attention.

781
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,582
Oh, his attention. Good.

782
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,957
There's no...
There's no instruments.

783
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,040
There's nothing here!

784
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,999
And are you
enjoying the hotel?

785
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,665
I'm so glad
you asked. I mean--

786
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,874
I'm obviously being sarcastic.

787
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,082
- Go! Systems go.
- Hey!

788
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,332
Engage.

789
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,457
- Oh, no. Other way.
- What you think you're doing?

790
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,749
Find the creature.
And remember,

791
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,207
you must use discretion.

792
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,083
- Discretion is my middle name.
- How do I stop this thing?

793
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,749
Oh, brilliant.

794
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,999
Is it too late
to vaporize the planet?

795
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,540
Finger's always
on the trigger, ma'am.

796
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,165
No, no. I'm joking.

797
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,958
What an adorable
little psychopath.

798
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,999
You know,
you didn't even like that job.

799
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,375
I don't wanna hear it.

800
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,415
And I cleaned the house
before work,

801
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:19,790
so please don't make a mess.

802
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,124
Aah! Ooh!

803
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,040
Lilo,
he's getting water everywhere.

804
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:26,208
I'm giving him
a bath right now.

805
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,582
Yeah,
we're not really equipped

806
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,790
to handle a pet
right now and--

807
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,040
We have it down here

808
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:34,999
that it was a black Lab, no?

809
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,791
No, I didn't say it was black.
I said it was blue.

810
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,374
- Stitch!
- What's going on in there?

811
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:44,749
Everything's fine!

812
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,040
Stitch,

813
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,790
you need to listen to me.

814
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,625
No, no, no, Stitch!

815
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,791
Stitch, get back here.
We're not done.

816
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,041
Get him back
in the bath now.

817
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,083
Where did he go?

818
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,957
There!

819
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,208
Be careful!

820
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:11,165
â™ª Ain't
Nothin' but a hound dog â™ª

821
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,415
â™ª Cryin' all the time... â™ª

822
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,999
Do not go in my clean kitchen.

823
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,207
He's exploring
his new house.

824
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,832
â™ª And you ain't
No friend of mine â™ª

825
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:19,874
That's it.

826
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,040
Ew!

827
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,457
He's just curious.

828
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,249
Lilo! Help me.

829
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,499
He's a puppy.

830
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,166
It's not a puppy, Lilo.
I'm not even sure it's a dog.

831
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,333
Ooh!

832
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,291
No, no, no.

833
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,832
- Get down.
- Stitch, stop.

834
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:41,957
Fire.

835
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,332
We are taking it back.

836
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,375
First thing tomorrow morning.

837
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,040
Why are you so strong?

838
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,749
But I wished for him,
and he came true.

839
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,915
We said one day.
That was our deal.

840
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,707
What does that say?
On the 'fridgerator.

841
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,040
We are not keeping this thing.

842
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,624
- "Ê»ohana." means family.
- No.

843
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,040
- Family means...
- Dude. No.

844
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,290
...nobody gets
left behind or...

845
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,332
Or forgotten. I...

846
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,165
Why are you
trying to go

847
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,790
against what MÄmÄ
and PÄpÄ said?

848
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,541
Because we were left behind.

849
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,041
Look,

850
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:26,499
I know all that stuff
sounds so nice.

851
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,582
It sounds really nice
to me too,

852
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,416
but that is not reality.

853
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,582
This is reality.

854
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:36,124
And I need you
to start living in it with me.

855
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,916
Look, can you just
get control of your dog?

856
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,582
And I don't
even wanna think about

857
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,583
what social services
is gonna do.

858
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,040
Agent Foster,
get me the social worker.

859
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:55,083
I'm going undercover.

860
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,916
You've got to stop
causing problems, Stitch.

861
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,249
You can play with Scrump,
but be nice.

862
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,415
She was my best friend
before you.

863
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,957
Hey, stop it.

864
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:08,082
Bad dog. Bad dog.

865
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,791
Don't pull on her head.

866
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,208
She's recovering from surgery.

867
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,250
Hey, that's my favorite photo.
Stop it.

868
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,707
This is kapu, okay?
That means "off limits."

869
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,416
Don't ever, ever touch this.

870
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,583
Now be good.

871
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,250
Be good for one second.

872
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,250
She was smartest
in her whole class.

873
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,249
That's a board.

874
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,000
That's how you surf.

875
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,832
Oh. This is how she trained.
She was great at it.

876
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:01,500
And she has a whole room
fulled with trophies.

877
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,124
We used to go
to the beach all the time.

878
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,916
She used to be fun.

879
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,207
I wish you could have
met her then.

880
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,957
I don't think
you're supposed to drink that.

881
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,041
Huh?

882
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,625
Did you have a family?

883
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,166
Fa... Fam...

884
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,041
- Family?
- Family.

885
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:31,041
- Family.
- That's close.

886
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,832
Like MÄmÄ and PÄpÄ.

887
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:37,665
The people at home who give
you lots of hugs and kisses.

888
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:41,041
And they're there for you,
even when...

889
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:42,666
No.

890
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,375
No family.

891
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,625
Is that why
you act bad sometimes?

892
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,999
It's okay.

893
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,415
Maybe my parents talked
to your parents

894
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,415
and they sent us
to each other.

895
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:57,500
Yeah.

896
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,665
Oh, that's hula.

897
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:04,749
Uh, hula?

898
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,457
It's a Hawaiian dance.

899
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,000
You wanna try?

900
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,374
- MÄkaukau.
- Hmm?

901
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,416
Now, follow what I do.

902
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:23,457
â™ª Aloha Ê»oe â™ª

903
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:27,165
â™ª E ke onaona â™ª

904
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:31,290
â™ª Noho i ka lipo â™ª

905
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,790
â™ª One fond embrace â™ª

906
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,541
â™ª A hoÊ»i aÊ»e au â™ª

907
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:46,166
â™ª Until we meet again â™ª

908
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,458
I'm so glad I found you.

909
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,166
Can I kiss your nose?

910
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,041
Nani, Nani!

911
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:17,290
- You have to see this.
- Hmm?

912
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,582
Okay, just like we practiced.

913
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,083
- What are you doing?
- Watch this.

914
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,708
I'm excited.

915
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,625
Go. I'm watching.

916
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,249
â™ª We can't go on together â™ª

917
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,165
â™ª With suspicious minds â™ª

918
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,540
I love that song.

919
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,083
Did you even see?

920
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,665
Oh. We're gonna be late.

921
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,665
Come on. Turn that off.
Go get your shoes.

922
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,082
That's like a superpower.

923
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,040
- The superpower I have is...
- Come on. Let's go.

924
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,915
...sometimes
when I run too fast, I fart.

925
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:57,915
Nice to meet you.

926
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:00,832
I appreciate someone with your
seniority coming to help us.

927
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,375
Well, this is
my top priority. Wha--

928
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,499
- Okay, come on.
- Stitch!

929
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,624
- Let's go. Let's go. Hurry up.
- Go, go, go!

930
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,541
We're already late.
We gotta go.

931
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,082
Mrs. Kekoa.

932
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,375
This is
our social services director.

933
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,749
- Hello.
- Hi.

934
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,665
I thought you weren't
coming in until next week.

935
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,082
No, Nani.
Your case has been elevated.

936
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:24,415
So, this is Lilo.

937
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:27,290
And who is this little friend?

938
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,374
That's my new dog.

939
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,040
Nani, I heard
what happened last night.

940
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,541
Can we talk for a second?

941
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah. Sure.

942
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,374
- His name is Stitch.
- Oh, Stitch.

943
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,665
If he knew what was happening,

944
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,499
you would lose Lilo right now,
that's all I'm saying.

945
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,624
It shouldn't have
happened in the first place.

946
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,165
- So that was a lot.
- Yeah, and you lost your job.

947
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,750
Hey! What are you doing?

948
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,333
You don't look
like a social worker.

949
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,874
I'm a special rank.

950
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,582
Your knuckles say, "Cobra."

951
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,290
- You can read, huh?
- Yeah, I can read.

952
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,790
I'm reading you like a book.

953
00:53:58,791 --> 00:54:00,540
That's how
I'll get health insurance.

954
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,624
Don't even worry about it.

955
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,165
You said I had until
the end of the week, right?

956
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,166
Lilo, Stitch,
let's go find a job.

957
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:09,165
Gotcha.

958
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,708
But I do want to know
a little bit more about you.

959
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,624
Okay, what would you like
to know about me, Pleakley?

960
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,250
Where'd you get
the name Jumba?

961
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,125
It's a family name.

962
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,625
- Are you related--
- There's the truck.

963
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,790
Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

964
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,541
We have to catch him today.

965
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,540
Why did you choose
this foolish method

966
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,624
of transportation?

967
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,166
They're eco-friendly.

968
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,374
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Hop to it.

969
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,499
- Okay, this is it, Lilo. Okay?
- Let's play Simon Says.

970
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,750
This is our last shot.

971
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,415
If I don't find a job
by today...

972
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:43,707
Simon says wiggle your butt.

973
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,665
...then we are going
to be separated.

974
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:47,957
- Simon says wiggle your legs.
- Hey. Listen.

975
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,791
For real.

976
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,790
I need you and him
to be on your best behavior.

977
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,416
Okay? Yeah?

978
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,166
Okay, wish me luck.

979
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:06,082
Okay, Stitch,
Nani's counting on us.

980
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,916
So let's get to work.
Ready? Sit.

981
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,915
Okay, class, listen up.

982
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,415
This is your badness level.

983
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,207
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

984
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,499
But we'll fix that.

985
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,040
So, lesson number one.

986
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,874
Lend a helping hand.

987
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,832
Or a paw.

988
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,124
This is how you clean.

989
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,041
First, use this.

990
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,541
- Okay, we gotta get closer.
- Okay.

991
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:39,957
That's not...

992
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,124
Lesson number two.

993
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,290
Don't wreck stuff.

994
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,790
It's really fragile,
so you can't break it

995
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,415
every time when you--

996
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:49,125
Now, it's your turn.

997
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,790
You can't just say,
"Let's get scooters,"

998
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,332
- and that's a plan.
- I've been trying to be--

999
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,790
Oh!

1000
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,040
A sneeze!

1001
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,415
Can you
tell me how you did it?

1002
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,957
I have no idea.
I looked at the light.

1003
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:09,790
Lesson three. Make amends.

1004
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,041
There you go.

1005
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:22,165
No. Hey. Hey.

1006
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,624
- Good job, Stitch.
- I'm excited.

1007
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,958
You know what I mean?

1008
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,041
How did it go?

1009
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,207
- Not at this hotel.
- Wait. Well...

1010
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,040
- Uh...
- Mm-mmm.

1011
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,458
Hmm.

1012
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,749
Nani, Nani, Nani!

1013
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

1014
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:56,708
Maybe you can do
something you love.

1015
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,082
Go! Go! Go! And pop!

1016
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,166
Yeah, Nani!

1017
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,083
Yeah!

1018
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:39,499
Hey!

1020
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,000
What are you doing?

1021
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,332
Why'd you make him so quick?

1022
00:58:58,208 --> 00:58:59,332
Get off, Stitch.

1023
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,749
Lilo?

1024
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,666
Nani!

1025
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,166
Lilo? Lilo?

1026
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:17,582
...drowning!

1027
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,250
- Lifeguard!
- Lilo!

1028
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,915
Get off of her!

1029
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,125
David, help!

1030
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,916
Stitch is pulling her under.

1031
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:39,375
Code 51. I repeat, Code 51.

1032
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,707
Send an extraction team now.

1033
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:42,915
Cobra, my hands are tied

1034
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:43,957
until the sample is processed.

1035
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,207
Someone's after it too.

1036
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,082
The next chance I get,
I'm catching him.

1037
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,582
You're good. You're good.
You're good. David, help.

1038
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,749
- Help, help, help.
- You got her?

1039
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,915
Okay. David, help, help.

1040
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,957
- Lilo, can you hear me?
- Baby.

1041
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,875
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

1042
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:58,833
Call an ambulance!

1043
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:09,583
Well, folks.

1044
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,665
She asked if she could ride
in the MRI machine.

1045
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:14,374
I told her
I would check with you.

1046
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,999
She's fine.

1047
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,040
She got lucky.

1048
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:22,540
A few more seconds,
it could've been much worse.

1049
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,916
But, overall...

1050
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:26,332
Is that a--

1051
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,207
It's a service animal.

1052
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,290
Okay.

1053
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,290
And you can see the front.
They'll run your insurance.

1054
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,375
Okay?

1055
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,750
Mahalo.

1056
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:39,958
Uh-oh. What?

1057
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,832
No. No. Absolutely not.

1058
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,708
It's not just the bills, Nani.

1059
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,958
It's time for you to think
about what's best for Lilo.

1060
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:54,125
There's a way that the state
will pay for all of this.

1061
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,790
But...

1062
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:02,082
it means that you have
to officially relinquish...

1063
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,000
guardianship of Lilo.

1064
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,083
What would that...

1065
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,416
look like? Um...

1066
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,708
Well, we take our lead
from you.

1067
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,500
You tell us
how you want to proceed.

1068
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:23,416
It's really about making the
transition easier for Lilo.

1069
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:25,665
You'll still get to see her.

1070
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,457
It'll just be different.

1071
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:30,249
You can prepare a bag,
a few toys,

1072
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,665
things that comfort her.

1073
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:34,124
And at that point,

1074
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:37,458
we would leave you
some time alone to...

1075
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,583
Say goodbye.

1076
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,083
No.

1077
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,916
We don't say goodbye.

1078
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,208
We say a hui hou.

1079
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,625
Until we meet again.

1080
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,833
I really thought
they could make it work.

1081
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,707
Why would he
protect her like that?

1082
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,457
You don't think
they're kind of cute together?

1083
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:08,749
He's not a pet.

1084
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,582
He's an experiment.
And a dangerous one at that.

1085
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:11,832
I just think he's a lot cuter

1086
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,124
than you think
he is dangerous.

1087
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:15,124
He has sharp teeth.
He has claws.

1088
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,207
I designed him
to be dangerous.

1089
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:17,791
Dangerously cute.

1090
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,375
Do not answer that.

1091
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,832
Pleakley, don't answer that.

1092
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:25,249
Pleakley. Pleakley.

1093
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,333
For me.

1094
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:29,290
Your Majesty,
Agent Pleakley here,

1095
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,415
not ignoring your call.

1096
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:33,040
We just intercepted
a call from human authorities.

1097
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,582
Do you realize
what you have done?

1098
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,999
- Nope.
- Play the recording.

1099
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,708
And take off
that ridiculous hat.

1100
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:42,082
Code 51.
We found something. Confirm.

1101
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:45,165
And not only have you alerted
the humans to our existence,

1102
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,707
but you still haven't
captured 626.

1103
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,540
Grand Councilwoman,
with all due respect,

1104
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,457
I'm not sure you know
what's going on with 626.

1105
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,458
We have found, um...

1106
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,124
a... a glitch.

1107
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,749
Which is making it
a little harder

1108
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,082
to get him off this planet.

1109
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,999
But don't worry.
I'm sure I can figure out...

1110
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,124
- We just need--
- A glitch?

1111
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,790
You're a glitch, you buffoon.

1112
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:04,457
I have had enough,
Dr. Jookiba.

1113
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:05,999
You have exhausted
my patience.

1114
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,665
Consider our deal terminated.

1115
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,207
- What?
- No tantrums.

1116
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:12,957
Agent Pleakley
is hereby deputized

1117
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,665
to detain you
under Federation orders

1118
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,625
and escort you
back to Turo immediately.

1119
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,124
Uh, hello?

1120
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,207
Now? Like now?

1121
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,290
No, later. What do you think?

1122
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,874
You cannot do this to my work!

1123
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,249
This is not a debate.

1124
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,749
A Federation detail
is on its way

1125
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,540
to clean up your mess.

1126
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:30,625
Did she hang up?

1127
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,749
Jumba?

1128
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,957
Yeah, the Federation has
always kind of been that way,

1129
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,040
overreacting all the time.

1130
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:40,499
But work's work,
and we gotta follow orders--

1131
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,582
- What?
- Aloha and mahalo.

1132
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,750
Oh, you're learning the--

1133
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,540
I really thought
we were getting closer.

1134
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:56,791
It's time to do this my way.

1135
01:03:58,166 --> 01:03:59,166
Oh, no.

1136
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,207
Hey, boo thang.

1137
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,540
Hey.

1138
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,957
What are you doing, silly?

1139
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:10,790
Oh, I'm just playing with my
dolls that I made at TÅ«tÅ«'s.

1140
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,499
- Aw, cute.
- Pizza!

1141
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,499
Um...

1142
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,790
So, remember that time

1143
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,665
that I went to the North Shore
that one summer?

1144
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:23,749
Yeah.

1145
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,749
And we were on
opposite sides of the island,

1146
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,749
but we could, you know,

1147
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,582
go and visit
anytime we wanted, right?

1148
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:35,082
We just weren't together
all the time.

1149
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,457
But we could call.

1150
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,207
You would tell me about all
of your fun little adventures

1151
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,915
with Alvin and TÅ«tÅ«
and stuff like that.

1152
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:45,915
And we could talk a lot,

1153
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:48,625
just not all the time.
You know?

1154
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:53,000
Is this...
Is this connecting at all?

1155
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,708
You're going back
to surf camp?

1156
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,750
No. No.

1157
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,540
It's just that with Stitch
and everything this week,

1158
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:06,791
things have gone
from bad to worse, so...

1159
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,416
we're gonna have to make
some changes.

1160
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,791
And...

1161
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:22,041
You know... I...
I have to get some air.

1162
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,166
Remember when PÄpÄ
took us camping out here?

1163
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:52,957
- What?
- Yeah, remember?

1164
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:56,374
I had s'mores.
And you also did too.

1165
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,208
PÄpÄ didn't take us camping.

1166
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:01,082
They were fumigating.
We had termites.

1167
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,750
Mmm. I went camping.
We had fun.

1168
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,125
They were really good parents.

1169
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,499
Hey.

1170
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,958
I changed my mind.

1171
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:18,750
What's that?

1172
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,207
Hmm?

1173
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,500
I like you as a mom too.

1174
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,583
Come on. Do it. For me?

1175
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,541
Okay.

1176
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:50,333

â™ª We meet again â™ª

1188
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,875
I want you to know...

1189
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:13,416
whatever happens,
I love you very much.

1190
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:44,833
You ready?

1191
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:47,666
Yeah.

1192
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,125
It's gonna be okay.

1193
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:20,832
I promise.

1194
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:40,083
Um...

1195
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,208
She's not here.

1196
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,291
What do you mean,
"She's not here"?

1197
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,290
I... I don't...

1198
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,291
Maybe she's
at the neighbor's house.

1199
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,375
Go, go, go, go.

1200
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:54,708
What?

1201
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,291
Where'd he go?

1202
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,750
Stitch?

1203
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,458
Stitch?

1204
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,458
Stitch?

1205
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:15,916
Stitch!

1206
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,208
I thought I lost you.

1207
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:23,375
S... Stitch break f... family.

1208
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:27,250
It was a accident.
Like a mess-up.

1209
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:30,041
But Stitch...

1210
01:10:35,916 --> 01:10:37,875
...bad.

1211
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:39,958
Stitch is bad.

1212
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,582
You're not bad.

1213
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,916
You just do bad things
sometimes.

1214
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:50,250
Ê»Ohana means family.

1215
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,250
And sometimes
family isn't perfect.

1216
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:06,333
But that doesn't mean
they aren't good.

1217
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,165
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1218
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:21,124
I didn't come here
to hurt anybody.

1219
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,499
I'm here to help.

1220
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,582
This animal belongs to me.

1221
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:27,166
He's not an animal.
He's my friend.

1222
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,874
Do you have
anything else to say?

1223
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,457
Hand me that.

1224
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,165
You don't know how to use it.

1225
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,708
I'm gonna count to three, and
then I want you to drop it.

1226
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,541
One...

1227
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:45,791
two...

1228
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,207
three!

1229
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,540
- Come on!
- Cool.

1230
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,415
You're a genius, Stitch.

1231
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:58,499
I made him.
I'm the genius!

1232
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,165
First rule
of stranger danger is:

1233
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,624
Find an adult.

1234
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:04,708
Nani!

1235
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,333
Nani?

1236
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:09,624
- Lilo!
- Lilo!

1237
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,165
This is all my fault.

1238
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:17,833
Hui.

1239
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,875
Ugh! And now I have a wedgie.

1240
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,374
Wait. Why would
I know where you sister is?

1241
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,790
I don't know. This is the only
phone number I could find.

1242
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,124
Do you wanna order
a pepperoni or what?

1243
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,790
Never mind.
She's back.

1244
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,375
Nani!

1245
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:48,665
Nani!

1246
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:50,125
Stitch, stop.

1247
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,375
Ow.

1248
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:04,832
Okay, 626, very clever trick.

1249
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:07,165
Funny. I got to stare
at my own derriere.

1250
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,415
I've always wanted to do that.

1251
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,708
What are you doing?

1252
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,582
Okay, listen.

1253
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,499
I... I just wanna say...

1254
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,582
the Federation
doesn't exactly appreciate

1255
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:19,833
what you've done here.

1256
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,082
I know you're in there.

1257
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,082
Come out, please.

1258
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,165
I've got huge plans for you.

1259
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,416
I mean, for us.

1260
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,707
Go away, hairy potato!

1261
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,457
Did you just call me
a hairy potato?

1262
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,999
That's not nice.

1263
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,875
Window, window, window!

1264
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:46,540
Wait! Come back!

1265
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:49,166
Hey! You're gonna run?

1266
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,207
You're not gonna run away
from all this.

1267
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,750
All these memories.

1268
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:56,624
Humans are so attached
to each other.

1269
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,082
To their things,

1270
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:00,708
to the alien experiments
they've stolen from me.

1271
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,083
We gotta go!

1272
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:11,040
"Attachment" means you care.

1273
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:12,500
- Hurry!
- Oh, no.

1274
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,374
Lilo! Hurry!

1275
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,957
We go now!

1276
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,957
And caring causes people

1277
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,875
to make very stupid decisions.

1278
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,875
Who is "May-May"
and "Pay-Pay?"

1279
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,540
That's MÄmÄ and PÄpÄ's room.

1280
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,791
Oh! That makes
a lot more sense.

1281
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,082
Stop it, or else.

1282
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:41,541
Or else what?

1283
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:47,458
What are you gonna do?

1284
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,749
Yoo-hoo.

1285
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,916
There he is.

1286
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,208
Aloha!

1287
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:12,540
I'm sorry.

1288
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,125
My eye! My eye! My eye!

1289
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,415
Why would you do that?

1290
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,333
Hey, stop it.

1291
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,165
I'm only trying to help!

1292
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,999
626, playtime is over.

1293
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,375
Ow!

1294
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:39,958
Ah!

1295
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:53,290
Okay, okay, okay.

1296
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,082
What's the plan, 626?

1297
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,832
Say you escape the Federation.

1298
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,915
You think you're gonna
just stay here with her?

1299
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:01,790
Live happily ever after
on Earth?

1300
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,791
You're built to destroy, 626,
and you have.

1301
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:07,540
Look what's happened
since you got here.

1302
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,375
Her family is falling apart.

1303
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:11,374
Let's just be honest.

1304
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:15,165
The only reason you picked her
at that animal shelter

1305
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,916
was for your own protection.

1306
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,375
Is that true, Stitch?

1307
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,332
See, I don't think that's bad.

1308
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,582
I don't think anything
you do is bad.

1309
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,125
I think it's genius.

1310
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,291
If you care about
this little girl at all,

1311
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,375
you'll leave her here.

1312
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:43,041
Stitch?

1313
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:51,665
Aw.

1314
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,375
This is for the best.

1315
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,791
Lilo, run!

1316
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:10,125
David, Nani, meet me
back at the house.

1317
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:12,415
You know,
you made the right choice.

1318
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:14,207
The Councilwoman
was gonna exile you.

1319
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:17,415
She was gonna waste
all my brilliant science.

1320
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:19,165
But I'm gonna do something
even better.

1321
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:25,082
And turn you into 627.

1322
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:29,833
- Lilo?
- Lilo!

1323
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,374
- Lilo!
- Not in here.

1324
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,582
- I'm gonna check the back.
- Okay.

1325
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,374
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1326
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,249
- Where's Lilo?
- I don't know.

1327
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,666
She's not here.

1328
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:39,832
Actually, she's on a ship
headed away from the--

1329
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:45,332
Oh, my God! Okay, okay.

1330
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,999
That was a really
impressive throw.

1331
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,083
If we can all...

1332
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,208
No, come on.
Not that again. I actually...

1333
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:55,374
Agent Cobra Bubbles, CIA.

1334
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,290
- What?
- Wait, what? CIA?

1335
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,499
Wendell Pleakley from the
United Galactic Federation.

1336
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,582
I'm a fellow
government worker.

1337
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,707
What you doing here?

1338
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,832
- Yeah, where is my sister?
- Great news.

1339
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,957
She's alive and well.

1340
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,457
Well, actually,
I don't know if she's well.

1341
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,624
This only tells me
the velocity

1342
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:08,749
of them moving away
from the planet.

1343
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,582
Enough! I'm taking you out,
and that's that. Let's go.

1344
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:14,624
You know, seeing you with that
little girl made me realize

1345
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:17,207
you're not the heartless
monster I thought you were.

1346
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,957
But once I remove
your capacity for love,

1347
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:21,457
you'll be perfect.

1348
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:23,749
And then, with 627 by my side,

1349
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:27,082
the Councilwoman
won't be able to stop me.

1350
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:32,540
Oh, don't look so sad, 626.
We have each other.

1351
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,165
I'm your "o'hannah,"

1352
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:36,207
just like your friend Lisa
used to say.

1353
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:37,915
Was that her name, Lisa? Lily?

1354
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:39,374
Limo? Limo... No.

1355
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,915
- What was her name?
- Lilo!

1356
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,124
Oh, yeah, that was it. Lilo.

1357
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,000
Horrible name. Let's get
off this planet, huh?

1358
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,874
Initiating hyperspeed.

1359
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:50,291
Ready to launch
in two minutes.

1360
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,582
You need to tell me
what is going on.

1361
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,457
- Where is my sister?
- Not now.

1362
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,082
The priority is reporting
this incident

1363
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,124
and getting this thing
into custody.

1364
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:05,040
People need to know what
kind of threat they're under.

1365
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,499
Uh, I'm not really a threat.

1366
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,124
I'm kinda quite harmless, actually.

1367
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,874
But you shouldn't be
that concerned.

1368
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,207
This is actually
my first mission

1369
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,374
in the field,
so I wouldn't really

1370
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,207
- be that concerned. Okay.
- Wait, wait.

1371
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,750
Aren't you supposed
to protect us?

1372
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:19,832
I took an oath to protect
the American people.

1373
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:22,250
Hey. What you think we are?

1374
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,624
Cobra, you were
right. The lab results are in,

1375
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:27,541
and we've never seen
anything like this.

1376
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,625
Please.

1377
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:32,790
There is something big
at play here.

1378
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:34,750
Have you found any
additional evidence?

1379
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:40,625
She's my sister. He's
the only one who can help.

1380
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,082
- Hmm.
- Okay.

1381
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,207
Also, I took off
your bracelets.

1382
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,500
They were uncomfortable.

1383
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,957
Yeah, it just comes down
to having a vision.

1384
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,832
That's all science is.

1385
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,665
- It's the ability...
- Red button.

1386
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:59,415
- ...to see what others can't.
- Push. Go.

1387
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:00,957
And I'm guilty of that.

1388
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,082
The Grand Councilwoman,
for example...

1389
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:04,249
No. No, no, no.

1390
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,457
...she couldn't see the future

1391
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,665
if it were standing
right in front of her.

1392
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:10,082
Oh, I wouldn't say that
to her face.

1393
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,666
Hey! What are you doing?

1394
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:20,166
Hey, 626, don't touch
those wi--

1395
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,999
Hey!
Do not touch another wire.

1396
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,874
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Please.

1397
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:26,624
I mean,
it's really frustrating

1398
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,582
to have this relationship
with you.

1399
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,874
I say something,
you ignore it.

1400
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,040
When we get back,

1401
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,374
there's gonna be
some real changes.

1402
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,624
Not so fast, pizza face.

1403
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,707
Huh? What the...

1404
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:43,416
Lisa.

1405
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,958
Let me guess, you don't know
how to work a spaceship.

1406
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:58,207
You little...

1407
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,040
â™ª You've got to get on down
Get on down â™ª

1408
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:02,415
â™ª Everybody â™ª

1409
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,332
What?
Why do you have party lights?

1410
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,957
Well, that's none
of your business.

1411
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,290
Why don't you just admit

1412
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,957
that your little friend

1413
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,124
is a dangerous,
freakish monster?

1414
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,332
Also, cute and fluffy!

1415
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,583
What?

1416
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,875
Hyperspeed. Ready for launch.

1417
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,958
Time to go home.

1418
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,457
Hey! What are you doing?

1419
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,333
No, no, no!

1420
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,749
Look, look, I had a pretty bad
"o'hannah" growing up.

1421
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,957
That's not an excuse.

1422
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,457
I just thought,
give it a little context--

1423
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,124
A hui hou, hairy potato.

1424
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,290
Can I just propose

1425
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:07,082
that sometimes
we need second chances?

1426
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:09,165
And that's just what I...
Trust me, I know.

1427
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,750
Pull up. Pull up.

1428
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,166
Pull up. Pull up.

1429
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:27,208
They're descending quickly.

1430
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,250
Can you go any faster?

1431
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:31,999
David, faster.

1432
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,458
You're driving like a grandma.

1433
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,915
- Jump!
- No!

1434
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:55,207
There's no way! I can't!

1435
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,708
Gotta jump.

1436
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,125
Safe together.

1437
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,041
Yes! Yeah.

1438
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:08,375
My photo!

1439
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,125
Lilo!

1440
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Nani!

1441
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:40,041
Lilo? Lilo?

1442
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:46,958
Lilo.

1443
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:13,957
- Lilo!
- Nani! Over here!

1444
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,416
- Stitch!
- Over here!

1445
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,250
Lilo!

1446
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,499
Lilo!

1447
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,041
- Are you okay?
- He's still down there!

1448
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,874
- No! Lilo, no!
- Stitch is down there!

1449
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,291
- No! Lilo, no!
- He saved me. Let go!

1450
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:12,665
We need to go.
Let's go.

1451
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:13,957
Listen to me.

1452
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,832
- Get on the board.
- We have to go save Stitch!

1453
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,332
He's still down there!
Go save him!

1454
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:18,415
- I'm sorry!
- Please!

1455
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:20,124
- I can't. I can't.
- Let's go.

1456
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:21,915
- Go get him!
- I need you back.

1457
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,749
- David, we need to go.
- We need to go, Lilo.

1458
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,832
We need to get you safe.

1459
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,500
We need to get
out of here.

1460
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,541
- Please! Go save him!
- No, Lilo.

1461
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,041
But what about Ê»ohana?

1462
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:44,708
What about nobody
gets left behind?

1463
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,541
Lilo, no!

1464
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,249
Come on, buddy.

1465
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:59,332
Yeah. We need something
more powerful.

1466
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:01,458
Like what?

1467
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:04,832
Try it again.
Try it again.

1468
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:08,916
Come on.

1469
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,708
Okay. We try that.

1470
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:38,957
Come on. Come on.

1471
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,790
Everybody back! Back up.

1472
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:44,875
Lilo,
get out of the way!

1473
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:03,500
Stitch.

1474
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:14,208
We did all that we could.

1475
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:27,458
We were supposed to
grow up together.

1476
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:32,916
I am sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

1477
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:40,791
Lilo?

1478
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:43,458
Stitch!

1479
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:48,125
The dog talks?

1480
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:53,333
I love you, Stitch.

1481
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,165
Oh, gosh.

1482
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:01,249
Ew, let it... Let it go.

1483
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:16,790
It's the family picture!

1484
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:18,290
- Aw!
- Good boy, Stitch.

1485
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:22,457
Okay. We're gonna
wash that after, yeah?

1486
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,832
AuÄ“. It never ends.

1487
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:48,208
Uh, just...

1488
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,916
Stay behind me, Lilo.

1489
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:53,999
- Just get back. Get back.
- Don't worry.

1490
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,458
They're just scanning
for deadly parasites.

1491
01:29:57,333 --> 01:30:00,499
We're here to retrieve
this dangerous experiment.

1492
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,375
Soldiers,
take 626 into custody.

1493
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:06,415
No! Hey! Leave him alone!

1494
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:07,665
Let him stay!

1495
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,374
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

1496
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:11,832
This creature poses a threat
to your species.

1497
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:14,082
We are sorry
for what transpired here.

1498
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:17,583
Rest assured those responsible
will be brought to justice.

1499
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:19,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1500
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:23,499
How dare you treat
a scientific genius like this!

1501
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,500
Hey, Grand Councilwoman,
can you-- Oh! Ow.

1502
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:29,124
My precious brain.

1503
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,124
As for experiment 62--

1504
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:32,915
- Stitch.
- What?

1505
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:35,415
My name Stitch.

1506
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,041
Stitch then.

1507
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:39,958
- Will be--
- Can Stitch say goodbye?

1508
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,374
Yes.

1509
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,625
Thank you.

1510
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,791
Come here, Stitch.

1511
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,375
We're gonna miss you.

1512
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:58,750
Who are these people?

1513
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,583
This is my family.

1514
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:12,041
I found it all on my own.

1515
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:17,625
It's little and broken,
but still good.

1516
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,291
Yeah.

1517
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,375
Still good.

1518
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,874
Grand Councilwoman,

1519
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:28,999
can we leave Stitch
with his new family?

1520
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,457
Absolutely not.

1521
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:32,457
The Council would
require supervision.

1522
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,165
And who would possibly
want to stay

1523
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,915
on this dilapidated
mosquito farm?

1524
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,499
- Me, me. Me! Me!
- Ha!

1525
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,707
Ridiculous.

1526
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:42,332
I cannot risk the global panic
that would ensue

1527
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,790
if this were to become public.

1528
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:45,290
What if it didn't?

1529
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,165
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1530
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:49,916
He's CIA. He's very good
at keeping secrets.

1531
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,165
Our reconnaissance said

1532
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:55,457
you were going to tell
your superiors about this.

1533
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:57,708
How could I ever trust you
to keep it a secret?

1534
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:02,541
Your Highness...

1535
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:05,583
you have my word.

1536
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,541
Hmm.

1537
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,874
You have all shown me
that there is good

1538
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,249
in this creature.

1539
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,749
However, I cannot reverse
the council's decision.

1540
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:26,583
Experiment 626 has been
sentenced to life in exile.

1541
01:32:33,166 --> 01:32:36,290
A sentence that will be
henceforth served

1542
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:38,166
here on Earth.

1543
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,958
Yay!

1544
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:47,957
Lilo.

1545
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:50,125
I'm so happy.

1546
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,707
Permission to hug
the Grand Councilwoman?

1547
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,833
- Still no.
- Of course. Yeah.

1548
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,583
We will be checking in
now and then.

1549
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:10,749
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

1550
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,541
- Come on, Stitch.
- Yeah.

1551
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:22,499
Hey,
look on the bright side,

1552
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,041
there were a lot of good
memories in this house.

1553
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:27,082
Some good.

1554
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,540
Some bad.

1555
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:30,790
This one's kind of bad. Yeah.

1556
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,540
At least
you got the wind chimes.

1557
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:33,915
That's crazy.

1558
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,624
Um, David?

1559
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,708
Hmm?

1560
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:38,582
Read the room.

1561
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:42,457
He is right though.

1562
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,666
Nani.

1563
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,333
Hey, baby...

1564
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,875
I need to talk to you
about something.

1565
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:52,249
I know. This doesn't
change our agreement.

1566
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,125
Well, actually...

1567
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:58,499
Oh, no. What's wrong?

1568
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,624
Nothing.

1569
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,083
Well, actually, plenty.

1570
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:04,582
Your house is destroyed.
Your dog is an alien.

1571
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:07,290
Our baby about to go
to another Ê»ohana.

1572
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,958
But that's what
we've been talking about.

1573
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:12,750
What if Lilo came
to live with us?

1574
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,040
Ooh.

1575
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:16,582
No, TÅ«tÅ«, that is
way too much.

1576
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:17,791
That is...

1577
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:19,665
Smiley already said yes.

1578
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:23,207
It is usually
a much easier transition

1579
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:24,790
in these foster situations

1580
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:28,000
if the family, hanai
or otherwise, are involved.

1581
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:31,125
I mean...

1582
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,750
TÅ«tÅ«, that would be amazing.

1583
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:39,374
I mean, after we rebuild...

1584
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:41,082
You'd be right next door.

1585
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,582
Really?

1586
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:43,666
No.

1587
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,666
You're so smart, Nani.

1588
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:55,249
I think
you should join the Marines.

1589
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:59,250
Baby,
it's marine biology.

1590
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:02,415
No. I, uh...

1591
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:06,124
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

1592
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:07,790
But I want you to go.

1593
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:12,041
And plus, that's what MÄmÄ
and PÄpÄ would like too.

1594
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,875
They told me so.

1595
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,041
Yeah, but, Lilo...

1596
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:28,125
it's my kuleana
to take care of you.

1597
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,040
Nobody gets left behind.

1598
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,790
It's also your kuleana
to make sure

1599
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,874
you no leave yourself behind.

1600
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:39,500
Look at what
your parents gave you.

1601
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:43,124
A good head on your shoulders.

1602
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:44,582
A sense of place.

1603
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,707
Pride. An akamai brain.

1604
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,208
A creative spirit.

1605
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,624
But most important,
you get each other.

1606
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:54,000
Ê»Ohana.

1607
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,041
Use them.

1608
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,916
Make us proud.

1609
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,457
- Come here.
- I love you.

1610
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:09,458
I love you too.

1611
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:13,124
Nani, maybe college
can teach you how to cook!

1612
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:15,207
Okay, okay.
Come on, Smiley.

1613
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,708
- Come here.
- Get in here.

1614
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:23,541
â™ª Lord Almighty,
I feel my temperature risin' â™ª

1615
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,082
â™ª Mmm â™ª

1616
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,540
â™ª Higher, higher â™ª

1617
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:29,583
â™ª It's burning
Through to my soul â™ª

1618
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:33,624
â™ª You see now
Girl, girl, girl â™ª

1619
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:35,541
â™ª You're gonna
Set me on fire â™ª

1620
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:42,000
â™ª My brain is flamin'
I don't know which way to go â™ª

1621
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,958
â™ª You know
Your kisses lift me higher â™ª

1622
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:49,291
â™ª Like a sweet song
Of a choir â™ª

1623
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:51,624
â™ª And you light
My mornin' sky â™ª

1624
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:53,666
â™ª With burning love â™ª

1625
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:09,832
Cobra comes
by sometimes

1626
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:11,749
to keep an eye on Stitch.

1627
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,040
He's a little scary.

1628
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:18,457
Aw, I miss that cute face.

1629
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,915
- I miss you.
- Yeah? You do?

1630
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:23,207
- Yeah.
- Well, speaking of that...

1631
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:24,790
Uh, hold on one second.

1632
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:27,165
Is that your dorm bed?

1633
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:29,332
How come it has bars on it?

1634
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,082
Are you in jail?

1635
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,625
That's not good.

1636
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:36,250
Hello?

1637
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:41,125
Nani? Nani? Hello?

1638
01:37:41,666 --> 01:37:43,332
Sup, nugget?

1639
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,915
Whoa!

1640
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:52,290
I missed you too, Stitch. Aw.

1641
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:56,040
Hey, Double-O-Seven, go check
on Lilo before you go.

1642
01:37:57,666 --> 01:38:00,499
Doesn't sound
like sleeping in there, Lilo.

1643
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,750
Get the gun. Go.

1644
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:04,666
Nice.

1645
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:09,290
It's jammed.
The trigger's not working.

1646
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,415
Try again. Hurry up, Nani.

1647
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:13,415
Better not be up
learning another one

1648
01:38:13,416 --> 01:38:15,833
of those tick tack
dances again.

1649
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:19,666
Go, go, go!

1650
01:38:24,291 --> 01:38:25,833
Golly, you're getting big.

1651
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:37,416
Good night, sister.

1652
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,500
Goony-snissers.

1653
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:49,540
â™ª Your kisses lift me higher â™ª

1654
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:52,582
â™ª Like a sweet song
Of a choir â™ª

1655
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,624
â™ª And you light
My mornin' sky â™ª

1656
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,500
â™ª With burning love â™ª

1657
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:04,458
â™ª Ah, ah, ah â™ª

1658
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,916
â™ª Ah, ah, ah
Burning love â™ª

1659
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,374
â™ª It's coming closer â™ª

1660
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:14,666
â™ª The flames are now burnin'
My body â™ª

1661
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,207
â™ª Won't you help me? â™ª

1662
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,916
â™ª I feel like
I'm slippin' away â™ª

1663
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,290
â™ª Oh, it's hard to breathe â™ª

1664
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:27,249
â™ª It feels like
My chest is a-heavin' â™ª

1665
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,915
â™ª Mmm â™ª

1666
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:30,249
â™ª Lord, have mercy â™ª

1667
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:32,541
â™ª I'm burning a hole
Where I lay â™ª

1668
01:39:34,416 --> 01:39:37,582
â™ª You know
Your kisses lift me higher â™ª

1669
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:40,540
â™ª Like the sweet song
Of a choir â™ª

1670
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,040
â™ª And you light
My mornin' sky â™ª

1671
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:44,708
â™ª With burning love â™ª

1672
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:55,207
â™ª I'm just a hunk
A hunk of burning love â™ª

1673
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:57,040
â™ª I'm just a, just a
Just a, just a â™ª

1674
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,415
â™ª I'm just a, I'm just a â™ª

1675
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:09,999
â™ª I'm just a hunk
A hunk of burning love â™ª

1676
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,208
â™ª Yeah â™ª

1677
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:14,291
â™ª You gotta burn it up, baby
Whoo â™ª
