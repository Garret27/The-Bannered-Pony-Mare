00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,394
You have a nice blush.

525
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,499
Well, since we're
clearing the air, I--

526
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:33,828
truth is,

527
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:37,605
I come to the market
when I know you're working
just so I can see you.

528
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:41,543
Yeah?

529
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,010
Yeah.

530
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:49,914
And I've been meaning to ask
you out for a long time now.

531
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:56,492
I always thought you were
checking me out.

532
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,793
I always thought you were
handsome, but I'm...

533
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,230
really shy.

534
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,469
I'm shy, too.

535
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:10,532
I can see that.

536
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,870
I like it.

537
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:16,941
I, uh... I...

538
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:23,445
I told my dad about tonight.

539
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:26,516
- Shut up. Really?
- No, I'm kidding
about that one.

540
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:30,552
- (LAUGHS)
- No, I'm just... I'm just
kidding about that one.

541
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,258
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.

542
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:33,562
My dad's dead.

543
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:37,995
You're a funny one.

544
00:40:45,536 --> 00:40:46,904
Oh.

545
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,776
- I--
- My mom's dead, too, actually.

546
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,982
You remind me of her a little.

547
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,246
Someone killed her.

548
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:55,980
My dad did.

549
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:03,823
He shot her,
and then he shot himself.
That's why they're both dead.

550
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,592
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

551
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:09,598
I live with my Paw-Paw now.

552
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,194
WAITRESS: Hey, y'all.
Good evening.

553
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,630
Can I start y'all off
with something to drink?

554
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:18,268
- Um, I actually think
we're ready to order.
- WAITRESS: All right.

555
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:22,944
I'll do the six-ounce sirloin,
medium rare. No fries.

556
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,311
And I'll also do the chicken
tender salad, charbroiled.

557
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:30,212
If Louis is in the back,
just ask him.
He knows how I like it.

558
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:35,048
And does the glaze
on the salmon contain sugar?

559
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:38,727
- WAITRESS: I'm actually
not sure, but I can check.
- I can never remember.

560
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,687
Don't worry about it.
I'm pretty sure it does.

561
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:45,535
I'll take the salmon.
You guys can hold the glaze.

562
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,867
WAITRESS: All right.
Would that be all?

563

KILLIAN: Let's trade out
the steaks.

564
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,772
I'll do the porterhouse,
20-ounce, still medium rare.

565
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:56,808
And what is your
soup of the day?

566
00:41:56,944 --> 00:41:58,338
WAITRESS:
It's cream of mushroom.

567
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,278
Yeah. No,
that's not gonna work.

568
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:05,846
Let's do two baked potatoes,
no sour cream.

569
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,255
Light bacon, please.

570
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,859
WAITRESS: Okay, got it.

571
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,221
And would you be able to do
a side of chicken breast?

572
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:15,096
Just chicken breast, plain,
nothing on it.

573
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:17,089
Uh, yeah, sure.

574
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:19,195
KILLIAN: And a Diet Coke.

575
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,964
And could you top
the water off, please?

576
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:23,296
- Sure.
- KILLIAN: Thank you.

577
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:27,001
- And for you?
- JESSIE: I'll...

578
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:31,680
do the shrimp salad, I think.

579
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:34,507
WAITRESS: All righty.

580
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,911
Thanks.

581
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:40,686
I'm sorry. I'll just hold on
to that, if that's okay.

582
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,515
- WAITRESS: Sure.
- Thank you.

583
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:54,598
- I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.
- No, I--

584
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:57,200
- I shouldn't have said it.
It was stupid.
- It's okay.

585
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:06,539
I just-- I can't believe
that you eat so much food.

586
00:43:07,576 --> 00:43:09,080
If you think
that's a lot of food,

587
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:10,987
you should see how much
Brad Vanderhorn eats.

588
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,545
Oh, yeah?

589
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:17,051
- Is he your friend?
- Yeah. Sort of.

590
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:19,596
Does he work at Super A, too?

591
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:24,266
- Wait, what?
- Your friend. Um...

592
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,460
- Wait.
- What is it?

593
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:30,101
You don't know who
Brad Vanderhorn is?

594
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,874
- No.
- Two-time IFBB pro.

595
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,312
- No, I'm sorry.
- He won the Arnold Classic.

596
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,574
Mr. Olympia 2015 runner-up.

597
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,451
He's been on the cover
of <i>Muscle & Fitness,</i>

598
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:46,579
<i>Flex, Men's Health</i> twice.

599
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,923
- Really?
- I...

600
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,322
- No? Really?
- I don't... I'm sorry.

601
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:58,162
Oh, jeez, you really
should get out more.

602
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:01,830
Anyway, yeah,
I've been writing him.

603
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:05,105
He hasn't written me back yet,
but he's probably just busy.

604
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,809
Oh.

605
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,638
Do you feel like the customers
at work just walk by you

606
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:12,973
- like you're not even there?
- Sometimes, yeah, I think--

607
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,977
Like they think they're
better or cooler than you,
or whatever?

608
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,053
It's really hot in here.

609
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:21,515
I'm gonna show 'em.
I've got nationals in ten days.

610
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:25,486
I'm gonna place
and get my pro card.

611
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,829
Then, I bet they won't
just walk by me.

612
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,290
So, what kind of
music do you like?

613
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:33,366
I wanna be Mr. Olympia one day.

614
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:36,998
I won't let anything stop me
from accomplishing this goal.

615
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:41,575
I've been training
for this competition
every moment of my entire life.

616
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:44,042
2016 Grand Prix, Dayton, Ohio,

617
00:44:44,177 --> 00:44:45,875
judge told me
I had small deltoids,

618
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,541
said they needed work.

619
00:44:47,677 --> 00:44:48,811
So what'd I do?
I worked them day and night

620
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,346
until they were perfect.

621
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:53,046
No sport on Earth
requires as much time,

622
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,258
energy, and commitment.

623
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:58,061
24 hours a day.
There's no days off.
There's no missing meals.

624
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,521
There's no missing sleep.
There's no missing workouts.

625
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,332
You can't do this at 90%,
or even 99%.

626
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,169
Take it from me.
If you're not 100%,
you will never be successful.

627
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:09,565
You gotta burn the boats
and bridges, and commit
all energy and focus

628
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:11,900
to being
the greatest bodybuilder
on the entire planet.

629
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:15,509
The body is not used to
the ninth or tenth or
11th or 12th rep.

630
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:20,917
No, you've gotta
go through this pain barrier,
and just go on and on.

631
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,785
And it's these last two,
three or four repetitions,

632
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,015
that's what makes
the muscle grow,

633
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:28,587
and that's what separates
one from being a champion
and not being one.

634
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:31,555
This is what most people lack,
the guts to just go in there
and say,

635
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:36,762
"I don't care what happens.
If I fall, I have no fear."

636
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:39,896
I've thrown up many times
while working out,
but it doesn't matter.

637
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:41,337
It's all worth it.

638
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,567
Jump in the trenches,

639
00:45:42,702 --> 00:45:44,401
face the enemy.

640
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:47,403
This is the most important
thing I will ever do.

641
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,639
You have to do something
big and important,

642
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:54,311
or no one will remember you
when you're dead.

643
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,686
