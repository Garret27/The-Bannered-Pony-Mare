1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,489
Long ago, the duke of Milan
commissioned a little-known artist...

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,368
to erect a mammoth statue
of a horse.

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,914
The time was 1481.

4
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,668
The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,297
The guy on the donkey
is just a guy on a donkey.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,052
Anyway, they called this statue
the Sforza...

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,390
and it was gonna be
the largest bronze statue ever built.

8
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,975
But wouldn't you know it...

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,188
war broke out,
and bronze became scarce.

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,441
So da Vinci decided
to create a machine...

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,236
to change common lead
into bronze.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,491
But when da Vinci
finally turned this machine on...

13
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,953
it was to give him something
more than he expected.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,292
Something much more than bronze.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,505
Leonardo, che pazzo!

16
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,181
- Gold.
- Gold.

17
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,829
Exactly 500 years later...

18
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,916
an artiste of a different field...

19
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,044
The one of cat burglary.

20
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,256
Was getting out of Sing Sing.

21
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,468
He was known
as the Hudson Hawk.

22
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,889
Got a coat, hat.

23
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,849
Here's your personal items.

24
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,851
Here's your wallet.

25
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,229
I think you'll find
everything in there.

26
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,189
Don't you want your receipt?

27
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,982
Keep it. Ready?

28
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,901
I got it, Charlie.

29
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,112
Eddie. Eddie.

30
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,656
So the Hudson Hawk is
finally getting out.

31
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,242
Remember all the reporters
that here when you came in?

32
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,119
"World's greatest cat burglar."

33
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,162
Now who gives a fuck?

34
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,580
I got a proposition for you.

35
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,457
Answer's no, Gates.
Even if you bathe.

36
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,460
Listen, smartass, as your
parole officer, I found you a job.

37
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,172
- No way.
- It's a terrific job. An auction house.

38
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,091
One night's work, and you're free.

39
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,428
No checking in with a shrink.
No more community service.

40
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,596
But I want to do
community service.

41
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,099
I want to teach the handicapped
how to yodel.

42
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,935
I ain't stealing no more, Gates.

43
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,563
Ten years later, you're still
impressed with yourself.

44
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,108
Same old coat, same old hat.
You're extinct, Hawk.

45
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,360
Coming from you,
that's a powerful statement.

46
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,404
Look, aren't you supposed to stop me
from committing crimes.

47
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,407
You know, "Book 'em, Danno."
"Give a hoot, don't pollute."

48
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,784
You ain't out yet, wise guy.

49
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,455
I can set you up and send you back
any time I want.

50
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:42,836
It's a very fine line
between ex-con and escaped con.

51
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,089
Hey, Gates, do it yourself.

52
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,176
Hey! He's got my keys!

53
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,719
I'll be seeing you, Hawk!

54
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,269
Open the gate!

55
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,360
- See you around, Mike.
- Take it easy, Eddie.

56
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,878
That's the first thing I did:

57
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,964
Smooch the ground
and taste the freedom.

58
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,133
Sorry I'm late, Eddie.
I miss anything?

59
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,928
As always,
your timing is impeccable.

60
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,683
- Where's the kiss?
- Get away from me.

61
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,936
No tongue this time, I promise.

62
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,607
What?

63
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,818
- Looks like you been expanding your...
- Don't say it, Eddie!

64
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,363
I'm incredibly sensitive
about my fucking figure.

65
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,991
My next word was gonna be
"consciousness"...

66
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,618
tubbo.

67
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,373
You're free, you son of a bitch!

68
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,837
Now that you're born again,
what do you wanna do?

69
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,298
Statue of Liberty?
Entertain some ladies?

70
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,342
Broadway tix?
Seduce some women?

71
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,470
Play Nintendo?
Bone some chicks?

72
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,641
What's Nintendo?

73
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,851
Just get me to
the Five Tone, Tommy.

74
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,354
I don't get a cappuccino soon,
I'll strangle somebody.

75
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,566
You still got a thing for those
unmasculine European coffees?

76
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,194
- What can I say?
- Who's your buddy?

77
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,365
The man knows! The man knows!

78
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,201
So, Mr. Coffee, you have
any trouble checking out?

79
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,411
Not much.

80
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,872
Gates just tried to blackmail me
into doing a job.

81
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,125
That doughnut-hole-eating,
son of a bitch...

82
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,753
take-it-in-the-ear-for-a-beer
rat bastard!

83
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,714
Had the perfect amount of foam.

84
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,508
Come on, I'll get you 10 of them
back at the bar.

85
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,094
An auction house? Gates wants you
to rob an auction house?

86
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,721
Yes, an auction house.
What are you, going deaf?

87
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,433
He's your parole officer, for Christ's sake.
And, look, I am not going deaf.

88
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,643
Tommy, just get me
in the Five Tone.

89
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,186
Yeah, all right.

90
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,731
"Going deaf."
Don't make fun of my hearing, right?

91
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,692
Tell you something about the bar.
You're gonna love it.

92
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,902
Five Tone Bar and Grill.

93
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,073
At least I know there's one thing
that will never cha...

94
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,842
I don't know how
to tell you this, Eddie.

95
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,536
Couple of brokers stopped in
for Stoli spritzers one night.

96
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,498
Now we're a nice local bar
that none of the locals can afford.

97
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,251
I read about these people
in Newsweek.

98
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,961
Where's all the regulars?

99
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,339
- Where's Crazy Jeff Cava?
- Gone.

100
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,799
- Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?
- Gone, Eddie.

101
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,302
Tommy, you took down
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

102
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,721
Eddie, Eddie, they're all gone.

103
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,806
But look at the bright side:

104
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,225
Half this joint is yours.

105
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,395
Hey, Blackjack! Give my
irritable partner a cappuccino.

106
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,064
I gotta go be a boss.

107
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,024
Give me a Scotch and water.
Thanks.

108
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:56,363
- Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!
- Yo!

109
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,115
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

110
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,682
Cute shot, Antony.

111
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,559
Cesar Mario. Antony Mario.

112
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,353
I didn't know the circus
was in town.

113
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,897
So why won't you do
the auction house?

114
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,358
Well, call me superstitious, Cesar.

115
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,195
I don't like to commit a crime within
24 hours of getting out of the joint.

116
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,323
It's very simple.
There's a safe on the seventh floor.

117
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,951
You take their thingy
and you put it in this thingy.

118
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,953
Directions even your brother
could understand.

119
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,996
Yeah, directions
even I could understand.

120
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,748
Shut up.

121
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,792
Hawk, you're the best.

122
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,920
You're the only one who can
do this job. You know that.

123
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,423
Don't tell me a lot of horse shit,
you wanna open up a hardware store...

124
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,717
go straight and sell spatulas.

125
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,804
You know Cesar, if the Mario brothers weren't
New Jersey's third-largest crime family...

126
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,764
I'd say kiss my ass.

127
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,059
But considering your status,
I will say slurp my butt.

128
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,269
- Sit.
- Sit.

129
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,396
Have you lovely ladies
tried our house wine?

130
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,606
- I think you'll enjoy.
- Beat it, Tommy.

131
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,525
No dinosaurs allowed.

132
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,694
Enough!

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,451
You don't do that auction house job,
I'm gonna put you on trial...

134
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,202
and I promise you, my friend...

135
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,121
there will be no bailiff.

136
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,623
You understand?

137
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,167
Get him out of here.

138
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,479
- "Witchcraft."
- Three minutes, 57 seconds.

139
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,315
- "Night and Day"?
- Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald?

140
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,026
- Sinatra.
- Five minutes, 12 seconds.

141
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,652
"Hit the Road, Jack."

142
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,863
Tommy, where are my
needle-nose pliers?

143
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,616
Check the bar. "Hit the Road, Jack."

144
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,870
Five minutes, 15 seconds.

145
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,916
How the hell could you take this down, man?
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

146
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,210
Don't you remember the night he came in? Nobody
could figure out where he got this thing.

147
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,086
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

148
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,048
- Yes?
- Quiet. Come here.

149
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,426
We got a nasty little safe
on the seventh floor here.

150
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,595
- Simpson?
- Yeah.

151
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,515
- What's the mechanism?
- Seventy-one.

152
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,017
Last time I went to bat,
Simpson only made a 40.

153
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,187
So it's gonna take you another
extra 31 seconds to seduce it.

154
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,356
- I'm not worried about the safe, Tommy.
- I know you're not worried about it.

155
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,649
What about these guards?
We know any of these guys?

156
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,858
No.

157
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,109
- Not one?
- Not one. No.

158
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,862
- Well, what about the video surveillance?
- I have a plan.

159
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,948
- Oh, you got a plan.
- I have a great plan.

160
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:45,615
Great.

161
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,746
What the hell am I doing?

162
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,124
What the hell am I doing?
I'm getting ready to do some crime.

163
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,653
Go rob some fakakta horse
with you?

164
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,836
All right, Eddie...

165
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,671
I should be out there
getting myself a Daily News,

166
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,319
looking in the "Want Ads"
trying to get a job selling spatulas.

167
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,883
We're moving too fast, Eddie.

168
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,846
You see, I'm putting out a fire
with kerosene.

169
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,432
- What is that?
- That's five seconds. My record's 18.

170
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,642
Is this funny?

171
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,854
You think this is
some kind of fucking joke?

172
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,164
- How many seconds?
- How many what seconds?

173
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,708
On the thumbcuffs.

174
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,004
Not counting the bitching and whining,
I'll be nice and say eight.

175
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,758
You know, they're not gonna let you
walk away from this job, kiddo.

176
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,262
I ain't never gonna get
rehabilitated this way, Tommy.

177
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,097
You think you still got it, Eddie?

178
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,474
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

179
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,978
- "Mack the Knife"?
- Four minutes, 17 seconds.

180
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,813
"I Only Have Eyes for You."

181
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,648
Why, Tommy,
I didn't know you cared.

182
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,108
Three minutes, 22 seconds.

183
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,068
- "Xanadu."
- "Xanadu"?

184
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,696
- "Xanadu."
- Four minutes, 19 seconds.

185
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,824
"Star-spangled Banner."
Whitney Houston, Super Bowl XVI I.

186
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,618
- Hi.
- Hi, Hank.

187
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,913
- Seven minutes, 17 seconds.
- You're full of shit.

188
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,441
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

189
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,462
How come I'm not out
trying to get laid tonight?

190
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,126
Eddie, you're bumming my high.

191
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,794
Come on. It's show time.

192
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,256
Tommy, hold on. Hold on a minute.

193
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,467
The sign here says
"no horseplay in the pool area."

194
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,927
This isn't horseplay.

195
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,429
This is a major felony.

196
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,674
Come on, Grandpa.

197
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,634
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

198
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,469
Give me one good reason
why we're up here.

199
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,223
I can give you two:
Antony Mario and Cesar Mario.

200
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,683
Well, you don't really think
that they're gonna...

201
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,851
Cut off our balls
if we don't do the job.

202
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,395
I see.

203
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,688
- Let me ask you something else.
- What?!

204
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,981
- Did you have dinner tonight?
- Why?

205
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,274
Because this rope only holds
900 pounds.

206
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,902
- Eddie, stop fooling around!
- I'm not fooling around.

207
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,113
You are! You're fooling around!

208
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,241
- Pick me up. Pick me up.
- All right, all right.

209
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,535
- Come on.
- I wish you'd lay off the pasta.

210
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,295
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

211
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,007
Covering our tracks.
We leave through the basement.

212
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,175
Well, now we have
no choice, do we?

213
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,564
- What?
- I better make the hole a little bigger.

214
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,525
Don't worry, bonehead.
I'm wearing my girdle.

215
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,808
Six hundred and seventy-three Wongs
in the phone book.

216
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,227
That's a hell of a lot of "Wong" numbers.

217
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,396
Look up "Chin."

218
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,330
That's it.

219
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,332
- You got a key?
- No.

220
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,042
Just checking.

221
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,065
They record everything
video surveillance takes in.

222
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,317
Yes, I can see that, master thief.

223
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,652
I thought you
said something about a plan.

224
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,738
Oh, am I boring you, smartass?

225
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,407
Hey, Jerry, check out Big Stan.

226
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,288
Watch this.

227
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,710
Big Stan!

228
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,925
Now watch.
A little rewind and replay...

229
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,053
and the guards are gonna be
watching a rerun...

230
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,805
and they're gonna miss out
on tonight's exciting episode.

231
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,682
- You figure this out by yourself?
- Yeah.

232
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,933
Good plan, junior.

233
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,812
We got about five minutes
and change.

234
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,939
Five thirty-two,
"Swinging on a Star."

235
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,859
You know the invented something
while you were inside. It's called a watch.

236
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,277
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

237
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,616

238
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,993

- and I'm robbing an auction house.
- Let's go, Hawk.

277
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,876
Hey, Dean, I don't get it.

278
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,045
I'm looking at the auction room,
and I see that little blue chair.

279
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,048
I didn't wanna do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

280
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,258
Snap out of it!

281
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,261
You think that's strange,
check out screen two.

282
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,846
Hey, that's us.

283
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,764
- Somebody rewired the recorders.
- Shit!

284
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,132

288

- Let's go out the back way.
- Keep those ideas coming.

289
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,253
Get up. You're embarrassing me.

290
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,675
- Would you get going!
- Come on, go!

291
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,221
- Go, go, go.
- Easy with that.

292
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,392
Come on! Beat it, Tommy!
Come on!

293
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,645
I can't tell you how happy I am
that we covered our tracks.

294
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,525
- Can I ask a question?
- What?

295
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,486
I'm not as fat as that guard, am I?

296
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,947
Oh, no. You're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

297
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,577
Come on, Slim Jim.

298
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,883
Hudson Hawk gets
the chair of honor.

299
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,469
Good job. Not pretty, but good.

300
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,348
All this trouble for a horsey.

301
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,769
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

302
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,562
- You certainly do.
- So...

303
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,442
when's this Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace-looking,
butler-head motherfucker getting here?

304
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,654
Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

305
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,329
- Sorry, Jeeves.
- May I?

306
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,000
Exquisite.

307
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:45,297
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the duke of Milan.

308
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,133
Irreplaceable.

309
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,845
Hey, Mr. French. I'm...

310
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,847
What the...? What.?

311
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes...

312
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,852
You son of a bitch.

313
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,439
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards.

314
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,816
Now, where's my cut?

315
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,869
So much for his cut.

316
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,038
Forgive my dry British humor.

317
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,419
You know, I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut too.

318
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,220
Lovely work, Alfred.
You taking the Concorde back?

319
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,431
Always, Mr. Mario.

320
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,729
I'm really racking up
those frequent-flier points.

321
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,815
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

322
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,736
Yo, Five-Tone.

323
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,779
Did I miss anything?

324
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,408
Gates tries to blackmail me.
You ask me, "Did I miss anything?"

325
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,743
Gates gets killed.

326
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,745
You say, "Did I miss anything?"

327
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,330
I bet you'd go up to
Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre:

328
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,583
And say, "How was the show?
Did I miss anything?"

329
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,050
- You may wanna get this looked at.
- Jeez, Gates was killed?

330
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,927
So who do we send
a thank-you note to?

331
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,220
The butler did it.

332
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,056
Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

333
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,392
Took Mr. Ed, Humpty-Dumptied it
over Gates' head, and get this:

334
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,647
- He said it was made by Leonardo...
- Da Vinci's Sforza.

335
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,094
I consider it to be the prize...

336
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,611
of tonight's auction
of objets d'equestrian.

337
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,363
Horse things.

338
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,949
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

339
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,408
Morning edition.

340
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,912
It says here, two thieves
attempted to steal it last night...

341
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,290
but thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

342
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,875
Attempted?

343
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:49,296
I didn't wanna steal the goddamned thing in
the first place, but I do have my pride.

344
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,798
I don't understand this.

345
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,591
Why try? Forget about it.

346
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,553
Because I'm tired of not
understanding things. Cops, Mafia...

347
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,160
butlers forcing me to steal something which
now it appears I didn't steal after all.

348
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,851
It's all too goddamn
peculiar, Tommy.

349
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,380
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

350
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,896
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

351
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,733
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

352
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:14,613
Now, who will start at 140,000?

353
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,490
Hundred-and-forty thousand.

354
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,075
Hundred-and-sixty thousand?

355
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,745
Seventy? Eighty? Ninety thousand.

356
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,164
Two hundred?

357
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,709
Twenty.

358
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,376
Forty.

359
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,592
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand.

360
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,429
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand?
Sixty thousand?

361
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,723
Seventy? Eighty?

362
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,643
Ninety? Three hundred thousand.
Three-ten.

363
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,978
Sold.

364
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,063
You know, after all these years...

365
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,233
I still get goose bumps
coming to these auctions.

366
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,820
The paintings, the sculptures...

367
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,364
Things that aren't really
paintings or sculptures.

368
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,243
Pretentious vultures who never look up from
their calculators to see what they're buying.

369
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,288
Now, that gives me goose bumps.

370
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,956
Auctions are disgusting.

371
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,583
I couldn't agree more.

372
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,627
Savages.

373
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,838
Now, lot 15.

374
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:18,093
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Trillini school.

375
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,764
Now, who will start at 250,000?

376
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,350
Two-hundred-fifty thousand.
Eighty thousand.

377
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,185
Thank you, sir.

378
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,479
Three hundred thousand.
Three-twenty.

379
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,315
Three-forty thousand.

380
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,901
No more on 340,000?

381
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,029
Sold once. Twice.

382
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,906
Sold.

383
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,202
And finally, lot number 17.

384
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,291
Thought to be lost in the war,
and again last night.

385
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,296
The da Vinci Sforza,
the jewel of the sale.

386
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,839
Fantastic.

387
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,841
Is looking like
a constipated warthog...

388
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
a prerequisite for getting a job
in the art world?

389
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,391
Doctoressa Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?

390
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,519
Some of us warthogs are
more constipated than others.

391
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,623
Oh, shit.

392
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,921
Perfection.

393
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,050
The Vatican extends its jealousy
to the lucky bidder.

394
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,844
Thank you, doctor.

395
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:47,474
We'll begin the bidding
at $20 million. To you, sir.

396
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,811
- Twenty-point-five.
- Waldo!

397
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,314
One hundred million clams.

398
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:59,194
That's $100 million
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

399
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:07,035
One hundred million and one, Waldo.

400
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,037
Fantastic.

401
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,583
One hundred million dollars
and one.

402
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,168
Outbid by mine own wench.

403
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,586
Quelle bummer.

404
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,964
Don't hate me, baby.

405
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,469
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

406
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,471
Any other bids?

407
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,181
Going once.

408
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:40,110
Going twice.

409
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,612
Gone.

410
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,678
My God. That was bold of you.

411
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,931
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's nothing.

412
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,618
Anybody would have
done the same thing.

413
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,227
No, I mean, you didn't
have to tackle me and rip my dress.

414
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,482
I'm just kidding.
Thanks for saving me, tough guy.

415
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,942
Why was that guard chasing you?

416
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,735
Because danger, doc,
is my middle...

417
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,587
Couldn't just play along,
could you, Eddie?

418
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,508
You gotta admit, Eddie. Classy way
of covering our tracks?

419
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,595
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at La Guardia any minute now.

420
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,599
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

421
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,612
Get the fuck out of here.

422
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,324
You stupid ass!

423
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,127
- Menthol.
- Hey!

424
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,339
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

425
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,260
Hey, mister. Are you gonna die?

426
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,021
Happy sailing, Hawk!

427
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,480
No! Oh, no!

428
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,773
How am I driving?

429
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,401
1-800-I'm-gonna-fucking-die!

430
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,614
Toll booth?!

431
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,248
Exact change?!

432
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,095
Make him roadkill.

433
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,597
Up yours, Cesar.

434
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,682
Yeah, run him down.

435
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,617
Cesar! Antony!

436
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,035
Are you okay?

437
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,874
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

438
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,771
The name's Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.

439
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,859
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

440
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,654
Well, it's better
than when we first started out.

441
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,489
Our code names were diseases.

442
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,993
Do you know what it's like
being called Chlamydia for a year?

443
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,953
Oops, forgot.

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,095
- My's Butterfinger.
- No shit.

445
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,894
Do you like
the company's new look?

446
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,230
I call them the "MTV-IA."

447
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,523
George, you promised.

448
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,693
No old-CIA/new-CIA jokes.

449
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,780
Punks. They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

450
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,616
and the Cold War has something
to do with penguins.

451
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,993
Don't I know you?

452
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,705
The last time you saw me, I was bald
with a beard and no mustache...

453
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,832
and I had a different nose.

454
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,793
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

455
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,171
My high school science teacher?

456
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,091
I'm the guy who tricked you into
robbing the government installation...

457
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,469
and then had you
sent to prison for it.

458
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,429
George Kaplan.

459
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,310
I'm not the type
to hold a grudge, George.

460
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,313
I used you as a diversion.

461
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,732
I guess down deep,
I was just jealous.

462
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,069
You were one hell of a thief.

463
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,946
To what do I owe
the dishonor of this reunion, Georgie?

464
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,200
I wanna make it up to you, kid.
That's why I got you this gig.

465
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,911
And to quote the late, great
Karen Carpenter:

466
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,913
"We have only just begun."

467
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,040
Three minutes, four seconds.

468
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,968
Well you know, George,
you're a little late.

469
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,294
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

470
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,006
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

471
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,802
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

472
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,889
Good God, what's that?

473
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,851
Now George, you don't expect me
to fall for that old gag, do you?

474
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,561
Shucks, I guess not.

475
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,065
Now?

476
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes, now.

477
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,792
No way.

478
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,670
Welcome to Rome, sir.

479
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:41,114
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

480
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,619
Why did you duck
at the auction house, asshole?

481
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,705
What can I tell you. I'm the villain.

482
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,917
Initially, it was a priority to keep
a lot of buffers between you and me.

483
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,878
But since most of them are dead now,
I thought, what the heck?

484
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,381
Hawkie, you come
highly recommended.

485
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,719
I hired Kaplan and the Mario brothers
to find me a cat burglar.

486
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,972
Hey. I want to be in business
with you.

487
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:20,695
♪ I've got the power ♪

488
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,412
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
and Minerva...

489
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,499
let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

490
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,087
Minerva.

491
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,630
Minerva!

492
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:44,344
Hello. Bunny, ball-ball.

493
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,637
So, Hawkmeister...

494
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,639
we got you clothes, great hotel...

495
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,684
and a 250,000-lire per diem.

496
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,018
That's $200 a day.

497
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,104
So he can get a hooker
and some tequila?

498
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,647
Veto, Darwin.

499
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,318
I guess we see who wears
the penis in this family?

500
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,905
For God's sake,
somebody chain this convict.

501
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,992
Listen, Hawkie.

502
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,954
This might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular joe.

503
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,125
I just want to be happy.

504
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,501
And happiness comes...

505
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,503
from the achieving of goals.

506
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,426
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

507
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,387
it's hard to keep
coming up with new ones.

508
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:32,142
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal:

509
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,020
World domination!

510
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,489
Shut up!

511
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,701
- Bunny, quit that.
- Bunny, ball-ball.

512
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,911
I think Bunny's got
today's ball-balls.

513
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,081
- Bad Bunny.
- Bunny, you weren't that bad.

514
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,335
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

515
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:03,256
But seriously, folks, Concorde me
back home, put me in jail. I don't care.

516
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,469
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

517
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:12,766
You'll have a Guinea barkeep
cellmate to keep you company.

518
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,518
You're young enough to still enjoy
shanking child molesters...

519
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,105
for a pack of smokes.

520
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,274
But Tommy Five-Tone...

521
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,860
will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

522
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,946
will be to attend
his own funeral.

523
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,037
Depressing?

524
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,000
I wouldn't waste a dime
for the phone call.

525
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,086
You don't have any proof.

526
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,546
The magic word.

527
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,467
It's "véjà du," Hawkhead:
Something you wish never did happen.

528
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,638
Kaplan and his CIA candy bars shot
the entire operation with hidden cameras.

529
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,643
They put the fake horse in the safe while
you clowns were running from the guards.

530
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,524
Yikes.

531
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,192
Damn Fotomat assholes.

532
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,760
That's a good shot of you, Minerva.

533
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,239
My man, you're going
to hit a church.

534
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,908
We want you to steal
da Vinci's sketchbook...

535
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,620
the Codex.

536
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,789
The Vatican.

537
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,792
I'm robbing
the freaking Vatican.

538
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,461
The nuns at St. Agnes...

539
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,338
predicted this.

540
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,674
What do they call you guys,
Igg and Ook?

541
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,247
- Hey, man.
- Buon giorno.

542
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,582
Yeah, buon giorno.

543
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,083
I'm being blackmailed
into robbing the Vatican...

544
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,086
by a psychotic
American corporation and the CIA.

545
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,839
I don't...

546
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,967
That's okay, colonel.
Just keep an eye on all the art.

547
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,271
Courtney, stop it.

548
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,232
You're embarrassing
your country.

549
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,661
Though Leonardo
is best known as a painter...

550
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,955
it was his gift as an inventor...

551
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,583
who drew together
science and art...

552
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,127
that is most incredible.

553
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,009
Tough guy.

554
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,095
What are you doing here?

555
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,848
You know, every time I get around you,
my heart starts beating really fast.

556
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,437
As you know,
the Da Vinci Codex...

557
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,775
has lived in the Vatican for centuries, and
will continue to live here for centuries more.

558
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,944
That's what you think.

559
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,072
- Question, sir?
- Yeah, what time do you get done?

560
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,075
His untiring pen
predicted the airplane...

561
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,744
the submarine, the bicycle...

562
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,414
the helicopter
and even the tank.

563
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,791
These more dangerous designs
inspired him...

564
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,334
Pokey!

565
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,559
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Quickly, come with me.

566
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,603
Pokey, come back!

567
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,025
Is that smoke bad for you?

568
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,890
- This way.
- Where are we going?

569
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,278
Through here.

570
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,747
Are you gonna tell me why you did that back
there, or are you gonna blame it on Dumbo?

571
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,290
You mean Pokey?

572
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,043
You believe that
kooky little elephant?

573
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,839
- What in the world is this?
- It's a postal subway.

574
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,217
- Can I get to Times Square from here?
- No.

575
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,094
The pope takes his mail seriously.

576
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,096
Christmas cards, Easter Seals.

577
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,390
Delivers up to 10 at night.

578
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,601
I see.

579
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,270
Well, actually, I don't see.
I'm very confused.

580
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,648
How do you know all this stuff?
What do you do?

581
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,275
Well, I do a lot of things.

582
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,070
But I don't steal stuffed elephants
from little girls.

583
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,447
My life's pretty boring.

584
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,575
Yeah, mine too.

585
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,495
You have dinner
with me tonight?

586
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,330
Nice, dull, boring dinner?

587
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,584
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

588
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,337
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

589
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,594
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

590
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,221
There's a place around the corner.

591
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,724
- Enzo's. Say 10:30?
- Ten-thirty.

592
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,143
Hey, thanks.

593
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,113
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

594
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,948
Report upstairs at once.

595
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,574
Yes, sir.

596
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,629
Did he mention the Mayflowers?

597
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,966
No, your eminence. He's definitely
going to steal the Codex. I can feel it.

598
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,677
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal, you mean.

599
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,221
The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk.

600
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,308
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

601
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:33,563
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

602
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:40,194
And must you flirt with him
so effectively?

603
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,155
That's the only way.

604
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:46,284
As an agent of our organization,
you are put in awkward situations.

605
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,663
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

606
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,144
Yes. Hello, operator.
I'd like to make a collect call...

607
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,647
overseas, to a New York number.

608
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,983
What? No, no, don't put me...

609
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,281
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you for calling AT&T.

610
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,033
What number
are you calling, please?

611
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,829
Thank God. 212-555-1989.

612
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:42,757
Pick up the phone, you
reindeer-goat-cheese-eating bastard.

613
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,593
Pick it up. Pick it up.

614
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,346
Pick it up, Tommy.

615
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,641
The black thing. On the desk.

616
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,186
Come on, Tommy.

617
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,785
Want a little more, Jumbo?

618
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,204
Kick your big, flabby ass.

619
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,289
Hawk.

620
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:19,585
Hawk, Hawk.

621
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,213
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

622
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,340
Yes.

623
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,302
I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Roma.

624
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,807
I did my first
bare-handed strangulation here.

625
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,684
Communist politician.

626
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,394
Why, George, you big softy.

627
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,481
God, I miss Communism.

628
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,608
The Red threat.

629
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,237
People were scared...

630
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:52,535
the agency had some respect,
and I got laid every night.

631
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,495
Brief him, Snickers.

632
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,997
Good news, Hawk.

633
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,040
Mayflowers have
moved up the timetable.

634
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,459
- You're hitting the Vatican tonight.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

635
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,503
The timing's off,
the schedule's not right...

636
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,006
I'm underequipped,
and besides that, I got a date.

637
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,757
Grapple, biker's bottle...

638
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,551
pocket fisherman, olive oil...

639
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,927
100 stamps?

640
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,138
Gee, stud, this gonna be some date.

641
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,639
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

642
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,309
Snickers, make that list happen.

643
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,895
Oh, it's one thing
to play hide-and-seek...

644
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,314
with the Mayflowers'
pathetic staff...

645
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,482
but we're sore losers.

646
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,610
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

647
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,279
You and your friend Tommy
would be nothing more than a...

648
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,323
A late-afternoon Triscuit.

649
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,866
Ciao.

650
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,827
Hey! Old man!

651
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,537
Yeah, you!

652
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,123
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

653
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,917
and I'll kick your
centrally intelligent ass...

654
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,128
up one side the piazza
and down the other!

655
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,722
"Beware the blue wire"?

656
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,768
Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.

657
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,519
Good, Yogi.

658
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,767
Now, Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

659
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,674
I was afraid
you weren't gonna drop by.

660
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,635
Am I late?

661
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,728
You look very nice.

662
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,064
You really do.

663
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,941
- What?
- I am the waiter, sir.

664
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,777
Oh, very nice.

665
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,155
Fettuccine con funghi porcini.
Prego.

666
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,450
And bring me a bottle of ketchup
with that, will you?

667
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,202
You heard him.

668
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,496
Ketchup. Ketchup.

669
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,122
Stupid Americano!

670
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,087
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

671
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,089
Steak burger.

672
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,591
French fries.

673
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,760
This is France.
You got to have french fries.

674
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,929
"Actually, it's Italy, Butterfinger,"
she said...

675
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,889
as if it made a difference.

676
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,853
To be in Paris and in love.

677
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,027
They had the worst ketchup
when I was in prison.

678
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,030
Prison?

679
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,991
I was a warden?

680
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,326
How long were you in?

681
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:53,664
Let's just say I never saw E.T.

682
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,501
You were in the joint...

683
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,255
doing hard time.

684
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,175
It's funny, but that excites me.

685
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,845
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

686
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,723
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check, please.

687
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,892
Where did you get the Hawk?

688
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,478
Ossining, New York.

689
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,398
Where did you get the
Hudson Hawk?

690
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,693
Well, a "hawk" is a slang word...

691
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,238
for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

692
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,657
I grew up in a town
called Hoboken, New Jersey...

693
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,105
which is on the Hudson River.

694
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,705
- So Hudson River, Hudson Hawk.
- Hudson Hawk.

695
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,458
And where did you get these?

696
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,251
Had a little accident
around the house.

697
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,962
- What happened?
- I fell on some chickens.

698
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,881
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

699
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,008
Maybe I can make them
feel better.

700
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,345
Well, okay. See what you can do.

701
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,191
Don't. Don't tickle me.
Don't do it.

702
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,442
Don't do it because...

703
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,736
Because I gotta
tell you something.

704
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,154
What?

705
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,406
No, I better whisper it to you.

706
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,367
Come here.

707
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,829
I can't do this.

708
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,335
What's the matter?

709
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,087
It's been a long time for me.

710
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,464
Well, it's been a really long time
for me.

711
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,426
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday
morning, this has been a very slow decade.

712
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,723
I don't make love every 10 years,
I get a little cranky.

713
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,685
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

714
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,648
Not that I ever kiss guys.

715
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,909
Catholic girls are scary.

716
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,079
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

717
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,337
This is not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

718
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,798
You went and did it.
You really did it.

719
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,093
In one day, in less than one day
of planning, and you did it.

720
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,137
You started the week
by stealing the Sforza...

721
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,184
- and ended by swiping the Codex.
- Yeah, but...

722
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,808
What are your weekend plans?
Hoisting away the Colosseum?

723
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,853
- But you don't...
- Tell me, did the devil make you do it?

724
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,814
Or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayflower?

725
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,108
Can't we just go back
to the kissing part?

726
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,988
What's going on in there?

727
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,532
You want me to rape them?

728
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,662
Here, just read your book,
Butterfinger.

729
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,879
"Not in a boat, not on a train."

730
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,965
Not with a goat, not in the rain.

731
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,135
- "I do not like green eggs and ham..."
- To yourself. To yourself!

732
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,929
It's more complicated
than that, Hudson.

733
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,640
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayflowers' peculiar interest...

734
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,100
in the three da Vinci pieces.

735
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,768
The Sforza statue was a fake...

736
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,480
but I was under orders
not to denounce it.

737
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,774
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

738
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,735
- You didn't know?
- No.

739
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,281
I'm just some guy
that's good at swiping stuff.

740
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,742
Who knew that would lead to this.

741
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,871
Christ, they even got
the CIA Involved now.

742
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,124
Here's looking at you, kid.

743
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,005
Hey. This doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

744
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,259
I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

745
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,807
Why didn't you say at the restaurant
that Hawk had hit the Vatican tonight?

746
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,601
My people will not be happy.

747
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,228
I want to see Kaplan.

748
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,156
Damn meddlesome
Vatican organization.

749
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,035
Hey! Way to go, Anna!

750
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,204
Hudson Hawk had
some interesting things to say...

751
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,373
about you and the Mayflowers.

752
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,209
Basically, that you're all part
of the same car pool.

753
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,755
Anna, Anna, Anna,
if that were so...

754
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,643
Almond Joy would've
handed you your heart...

755
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,051
right after you handed her
the Codex.

756
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,095
No, now the trip is this:

757
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,722
Soon as the Mayflowers find out
we have the Codex...

758
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,370
they're gonna want to make a deal.

759
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,060
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

760
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,063
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

761
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,066
I wouldn't worry too much
about him. He's...

762
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,193
He's gonna be in very good hands.

763
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,071
But you, you look really tired, kiddo.

764
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,279
Maybe you should go back
to Rome and get some sleep.

765
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:43,245
Kit Kat? Oh, there you are.

766
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,373
See that Miss Baragli
gets home safely.

767
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,085
Arrividerci, baby.

768
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,715
With all due respect
to that great dress...

769
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,592
how come you didn't you let me
cut her heart out?

770
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,012
Close call, close call.

771
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:05,183
But she's the only way we have keeping tabs
on the damn mysterious Vatican organization.

772
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,024
Bunny Mayflower.

773
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,964
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

774
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,654
It's been 1200 hours
since my last confession.

775
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,865
Hit me with your best shot.

776
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,950
I betrayed a man.

777
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,911
A good man. An innocent man.

778
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,288
A thief.

779
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,041
Anna, what are you trying to say?

780
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,127
Father, we've been
double-crossed by the CIA.

781
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,630
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

782
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,758
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

783
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,801
and a legitimate
government procedure...

784
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,887
but he knew right from wrong.

785
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,431
Oh, and we kind of messed around.

786
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,854
Messed around? Messed around?!

787
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,778
Seventeen Hail Marys
and five minutes outside.

788
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:02,658
So, Sister, what you are saying
is that Hudson Hawk...

789
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,077
is not willingly working
for the Mayflowers...

790
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:09,373
but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are?

791
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,667
I thought we were using the CIA
to get to Mayflower...

792
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,045
but the CIA is using me
to keep us away from Mayflower.

793
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,632
The pope warned me
never to trust the CIA.

794
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,968
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

795
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,596
the world economy will be ruined.

796
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,140
Ay-yi-yi.

797
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,101
Lord help us.

798
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:33,647
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

799
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,023
I'm going to find out.

800
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,608
But you must remember, Sister...

801
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,320
you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

802
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,699
Yes, Your Eminence.

803
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,200
Just say, "God go with me."

804
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,577
God go with you, Sister.

805
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:50,706
Ball!

806
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,214
Jolly good shot, sir.

807
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,552
Hudson Hawk.

808
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,846
You cease to amaze me, convict.

809
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,223
You are a terrible cat burglar.

810
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,475
Haven't you ever seen,
like, David Niven?

811
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,310
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

812
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,563
Like a cat, one would say.

813
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,108
I could take it back.

814
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,027
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

815
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,625
Oh, you two! There's nothing
I hate more than failure.

816
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,669
All you had to do
was follow the Hawk.

817
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,673
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

818
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,759
I suppose we're just going to
have to kill them.

819
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,601
God, Minerva, I was just joking.

820
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,951
- Get away from there, convict.
- Just browsing.

821
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,705
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

822
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,124
Oh, really?

823
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,876
Don't hurt him?

824
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,587
Even if he does this?

825
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,089
What about this?

826
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,135
Surely, this must offend!

827
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,098
Things are really heating up
at the Castle Vinci tonight!

828
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,892
Mamma mia, pizzeria!

829
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,101
May I call you Minnie?

830
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,313
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out.

831
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,232
Come to think of it,
there is a part of your body...

832
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,319
that you won't be needing
for your next job.

833
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,571
I always did wanna
sing like Frankie Valli.

834
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,283
Big boys don't cry.

835
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,331
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

836
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,877
Look, you Eddie Munster-looking
motherfucker...

837
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:04,246
somebody better tell me what's going on,
or I ain't gonna move another muscle.

838
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,758
- I wanna be treated like an adult.
- That's fair.

839
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,886
Now go to your room.

840
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,723
What?

841
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,107
So, Captain Hawk,
in one of your paws...

842
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,151
you've got a gold bar
worth about eight thou.

843
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,905
In the autre, you've got lead
that won't get you gelato.

844
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,325
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

845
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,661
That's one down. Kitty Carlisle.

846
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,204
Cool, isn't it?

847
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,208
Weight, feel, malleability.
They're all but identical.

848
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:44,170
On the periodic chart of elements
they're but one proton apart.

849
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:49,301
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

850
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,510
Alchemy?

851
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,179
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s, my man.

852
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:57,100
Minerva read it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.

853
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,687
I dumped some lire into research
and, shazam!

854
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,481
We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

855
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,735
detailing la macchina d'oro...

856
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,029
"The gold machine,"
for the hoes at home.

857
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,573
And the rest is
about to become history.

858
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,408
Money isn't everything.

859
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,160
Gold is.

860
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,411
Fuck T-bills!

861
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,913
Fuck blue-chip stocks!

862
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,289
Fuck junk bonds!

863
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,249
We've got the real deal.

864
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,251
Money will always be paper...

865
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,922
but gold will always be gold.

866
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,930
After a couple of years
of steady production...

867
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,730
we'll flood the market
with so much gold...

868
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,637
that gold itself,
the foundation of all finance...

869
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,263
will lose its meaning.

870
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,099
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

871
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:42,062
will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

872
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,271
Sounds like a party.

873
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,231
Markets will crash-crash.

874
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:48,360
Financial empires
will crumble-crumble.

875
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,487
Except yours-yours.

876
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,323
In 1992, baby...

877
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,158
the European superpowers
are coming together...

878
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,661
to form one business superpower.

879
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,914
And that's one party
we're gonna love to poop.

880
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,207
Well, that's set.

881
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,878
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

882
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,757
On display for three days only
at the Louvre, in Paris.

883
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,509
As opposed to the Louvre
in Wisconsin?

884
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,511
Shut up.
You'll make me lose my place.

885
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,179
You're gonna have
to go in at night.

886
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,598
- The security will be overwhelming.
- Twelve guards...

887
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,102
Okay, time out.

888
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,063
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

889
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,391
Put me in jail. Put me and...

890
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,899
Jail, you asshole?!

891
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,069
Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

892
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,904
Bunny? Ball-ball.

893
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,866
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

894
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:40,745
I'll kill your friends, your family
and the bitch you took to the prom.

895
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,498
Betty Jo Biarsky? I can get you
an address on that, if you want.

896
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,500
You have a dilemma, tiger.

897
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,962
And I think I know what's gonna
help you solve it.

898
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,802
I'll kill you all!

899
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,556
I swear to God. I'll kill that butler.
I'll kill that little yappy dog.

900
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,560
I'm sick of this!

901
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:11,818
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

902
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,154
"Keep off the grass"?

903
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,156
Let's play soccer.

904
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:19,200
The only law I cared for
was friendship.

905
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,704
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

906
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:28,710
I just don't think that it's such a smoking-hot
idea to leave them in there alone.

907
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,919
Relax, George.

908
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,922
That's why we hired the
pasta-slurping Guinea to begin with...

909
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,257
to keep Hawk in line.

910
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,510
This Gates-Mario brothers-
CIA-Mayflower-da Vinci thing...

911
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,723
I mean, it seemed like
a sweet deal.

912
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,933
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

913
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,436
I don't know, Eddie,
I thought you'd get into it.

914
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:51,399
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A.s at the bar.

915
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,319
But I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

916
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,364
Them using me to use you.

917
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:02,494
I'm sorry, Eddie...

918
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:06,039
but there's only
one way out of this...

919
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,918
and it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

920
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,049
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

921
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,510
You've got to love male bonding.

922
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,815
You fucked my freedom
for a lousy job?

923
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,278
Come on!

924
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,078
- You know something, Eddie?
- What?

925
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,789
- You hit like a girl!
- Oh, really?

926
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,166
I was only kidding.

927
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,510
Tommy! No!

928
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,595
Tommy!

929
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,696
Plan B, George.

930
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,450
Plan B?

931
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,106
No sweat, Tommy. You just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

932
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,525
Don't act like you never
committed a crime before.

933
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,819
- I know I made a bad call.
- What was your per diem?

934
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,031
- Thank God you're dead.
- It was so beautiful.

935
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,826
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

936
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,456
- Ketchup. You can't beat Heinz 57.
- Five-Tone.

937
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,583
- What?
- You fucked my freedom for a job?

938
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,377
- You don't understand.
- I said I was sorry.

939
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,338
You better be glad I don't hit women,
assuming you are a woman,

940
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,298
because from now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

941
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,758
- Hey, look, Eddie, I'm sorry.
- Hudson, I'm sorry.

942
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,552
I work for a covert Vatican
humanitarian organization...

943
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,387
and the CIA
made a fool out of me.

944
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,847
- What's more...
- Hey, man...

945
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,017
I care for you... I love you.

946
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,228
- Then what's this?
- Where did you get that?

947
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,771
The da Vinci castle.

948
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,482
You know, the place where you
gave the bad guys the Codex.

949
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,734
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

950
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,486
So they really were that
close to making it work.

951
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,574
But now that they lost the services
of the world's greatest cat burglar...

952
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,865
and his dead partner...

953
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,117
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

954
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,454
And we get to go home.

955
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,998
- Five-Tone, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

956
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,927
Why do they leave all these rocks
and shit laying out in the backyard?

957
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,544
They're called ruins, Eddie.

958
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,421
- Ruins?
- Yeah, ruins.

959
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,590
Good name.

960
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:12,225
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

961
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,769
I never saw a look on a face like this
when he got caught.

962
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,230
I swear to God,
he was so embarrassed.

963
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,440
You know,
speaking of being caught...

964
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,068
isn't the CIA gonna think
to check out this place?

965
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,861
No, they fell for the fake death.

966
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:26,656
They think Hawk's been arrested.

967
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,201
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
by my sources boarding a plane out of Rome.

968
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,120
- Hudson.
- Where to?

969
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,997
Five-Tone, will you quit
worrying about it, man.

970
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,749
I'm not worried, alright,
I'm just being cautious.

971
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,003
Okay, guys.
On that note, it's time for bed.

972
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,171
- I couldn't agree more.
- Okay.

973
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,011
Tommy, you're gonna sleep here.

974
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:51,306
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

975
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,682
Oh, yeah. Good night.

976
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,392
I'll get you some sheets.

977
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,477
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

978
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,693
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

979
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,778
- Is.
- Was.

980
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:08,072
There's some things
you don't know about me.

981
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,158
But there's some things
I do know about you...

982
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,203
and about me,
and about that bed.

983
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:16,706
This is not the time, Hudson.

984
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,960
Look, can't we just have
a late-night cappuccino?

985
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:25,173
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

986
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,678
- Yeah. I remember.
- Good night.

987
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,680
Good night.

988
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,647
Don't even think about it.

989
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,358
Don't say another word.

990
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,486
It's a very special night.

991
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,238
Very funny. Very funny, Tommy.

992
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,053
Good morning.

993
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,307
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

994
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,184
I'm losing respect for you guys.

995
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,146
You were that close
to getting away with this crap.

996
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,773
- Get up.
- Now, where's Anna?

997
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,525
You know, George,
it's nice of you guys to drop by...

998
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,027
but next time,
you might want to phone ahead.

999
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,756
Why don't you come back in a half-hour.

1000
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,448
Grab ourselves a shower,
pick up some croissants and shit.

1001
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:37,078
I really wish I could come up with this
glib repartee, the way you guys can.

1002
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,790
But I can't.
So I'll just paralyze you. A. J?

1003
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,168
Curare darts.

1004
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,837
When it comes
to instantaneous loss...

1005
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,880
of all physical control
below the neck...

1006
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,050
- I highly recommend them.
- Eddie, I can't move!

1007
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,594
I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

1008
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,222
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitches!

1009
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,684
Come here!
My head against yours.

1010
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,060
Fair fight!

1011
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,771
This is how I go out.
Like a hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

1012
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,857
Like a Gumby in the store?

1013
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,067
What the fuck are you la...?
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

1014
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,610
You made it come out of my nose.

1015
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,820
Keep that shit up!

1016
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,906
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

1017
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:16,534
The Louvre?

1018
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,831
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

1019
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,208
Or should I say this morning's?

1020
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,335
I admit we displayed
a lack of nuance.

1021
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,005
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

1022
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,133
Well, we weren't being judged
for neatness...

1023
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,051
only results.

1024
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,304
Goddamn it. Yanks lose again.

1025
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,057
- How did the Mets do?
- Can you turn to section B.

1026
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,980
You guys may be
the fairest cat burglars of them all...

1027
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,107
but if you weren't
such snobs...

1028
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,820
a lot of those guards at the Louvre
might still be alive.

1029
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,947
But that's irrelevant now.

1030
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,083
You're irrelevant now.

1031
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,169
Because tonight...

1032
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,838
at the Castle da Vinci...

1033
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,381
we make gold!

1034
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,550
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

1035
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,177
Ah, more babes for the party.

1036
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,803
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Anna.

1037
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:21,140
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

1038
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,059
Anna Baragli...

1039
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,520
Came to play!

1040
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,647
Anna-banana-fo-fanna.

1041
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,024
You're not gonna shoot
little old me, are you?

1042
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,109
You're not gonna
shoot little old anybody.

1043
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,111
- Pull the trigger. Shoot.
- Shoot, Anna.

1044
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,655
I read your dossier...

1045
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:38,199
- Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

1046
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,995
Why did she call you Sister?

1047
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,331
I'm sorry, Hudson,
I meant to tell you.

1048
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,917
- He didn't know.
- He didn't know!

1049
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,126
Know what?

1050
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,379
Hawk likes a nun!

1051
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,637
Those better be tears
you're crying, Tommy.

1052
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,472
They are.

1053
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,099
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

1054
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,060
Oh, no. You love me. It's your job!

1055
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,437
You probably love
Butterfingers over there.

1056
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,647
Well, yeah.

1057
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,984
In a weird sort of Catholic way, I do.

1058
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,236
But you...

1059
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,446
You...

1060
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,911
Well, Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

1061
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,123
- And as for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

1062
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,504
A souvenir.

1063
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,298
Ciao.

1064
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,011
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

1065
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:44,432
Guys, we got some good news
and some bad news.

1066
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,435
The good news is you'll be completely
unparalyzed in about two minutes.

1067
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,148
The bad news is that leaves you only
five seconds to defuse the bombs.

1068
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,858
- Bombs?
- Bombs?

1069
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,657
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

1070
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:04,285
I'll just shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

1071
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,916
Almond Joy! More paralysis!

1072
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,296
- You can move?
- Yeah.

1073
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,092
This is what I get
for darting a nun!

1074
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,763
Get this fucking thing off my head!

1075
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,267
- Tommy, look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a bad migraine.

1076
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,686
Maybe it was a dud.

1077
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,871
I don't know. It must be the curare.

1078
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,290
It's been known to have
certain side effects.

1079
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,126
Oh, really, George?

1080
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,130
I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

1081
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:01,717
Listen, Anna. The apprentice's diary
contains a code...

1082
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:06,180
that explains how the three
pieces of crystal fit together.

1083
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,932
If you could do us the honor...

1084
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,019
and decipher how the code works,
we would be eternally grateful.

1085
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,855
What does the color blue
taste like?

1086
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,191
Bobo knows.

1087
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,196
I must speak with the dolphins now.

1088
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,038
Just shoot her. Anybody?

1089
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,792
Darwin, this is supposed to
be torture, not therapy.

1090
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,346
- Eddie, the old man said turn left at the fork.
- He said turn right.

1091
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,090
If you wanna save Anna,
you gotta find the castle first.

1092
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,052
- Quit pushing.
- I'm not pushing.

1093
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,642
- Count of three?
- Why not just go now?

1094
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,019
- Okay. Hey, Tommy.
- What?

1095
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,272
- Who are you, Bob Hope for Texaco?
- What the hell are you talking about?

1096
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,232
- What are you doing with that golf bag?
- I got a plan.

1097
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,776
- Is it a great plan?
- A great big plan.

1098
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,629
- Tommy, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

1099
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:24,091
- How do I look?
- You look great. What, are you kidding?

1100
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,801
No. I want you to tell me.
Come on.

1101
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,261
I've been away a long time.

1102
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,555
Eddie, Eddie, we're hanging
off a castle in the middle of Italy...

1103
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,265
and you're asking me
how you look?

1104
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,267
Okay, okay. You don't gotta get...

1105
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:35,895
You look gorgeous.

1106
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,189
- You look like fucking Zorro.
- Well, I didn't know.

1107
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:39,482
Hey!

1108
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,825
A lifetime of service
and it's come to this.

1109
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,578
The dolphin is dead.

1110
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,413
The dolphin is...

1111
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,124
Come on, you bitch!

1112
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:00,461
I'm not a very good damsel
in a dress, am I?

1113
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,589
"You must pay the rent!"
"But I can't pay the rent."

1114
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,259
Yo, Flipper.

1115
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:11,305
A damsel in distress implies that there
is some well-hung Dudley Do-Right...

1116
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,307
galloping up to save you.

1117
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,767
It ain't gonna happen.

1118
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:18,437
Hudson Hawk go boom-boom.
He dead.

1119
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:31,867
- I'm thinking of using the 7 iron.
- Looks long, junior.

1120
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:33,619
- Six iron?
- Bingo.

1121
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,372
Thank you. Fore!

1122
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:40,084
"Fore"?

1123
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,418
Did anybody hear something?

1124
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,798
Can you fucking believe...?

1125
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,842
I heard something.

1126
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,762
- Did you set the timer on that thing?
- No.

1127
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,889
From now on, please set the timer.

1128
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:57,810
- Come on, Butterfinger.
- I think it's time for Plan C, darling.

1129
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,187
Kit Kat, you guard
the Mayflowers with your life.

1130
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,071
Oh, Kit Kat. Are you really
going to guard us with your life?

1131
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,782
Kit Kat!

1132
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,709
A double crossbow
for a double-cross.

1133
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,045
Oh, Alfie, you dry British madman.

1134
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,172
- Thank you.
- Catch you later, baby.

1135
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,723
- Why did you that?
- Try this one, Sister.

1136
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,559
Thou shalt not share.

1137
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,062
It's in the hole!
The gallery's ecstatic!

1138
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,564
Oh, he's gotta be happy
with that one, Tommy.

1139
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,773
So what do you say, Eddie?

1140
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,021
Two and half minutes to save Anna,
three and a half minutes to save the world?

1141
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,779

Okay. This way.

And we'll meet back at the clubhouse.

01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:31,612

I'll take that, sir.

1172
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,556
Hey, coach. Looks bad.

1173
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,350
I think those Mayflowers
set us up.

1174
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:51,525
Jumbo, we hardly knew you.

1175
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,322
Since you're not gonna tell us
what we want to know...

1176
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:02,161
then I think it's time for you to report
to the head office in heaven, Sis.

1177
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:06,206
If you see the big guy,
tell him he's a loser.

1178
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,833
That's it.

1179
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,056
- That didn't hurt.
- No?

1180
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:23,891
Try this.

1181
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,737
What do you say now,
you centrally intelligent scumsicle?

1182
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:42,951
Getting old, George?

1183
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:56,090
Tommy, you New York-Italian-father-
made-20-bucks-a-week son of a bitch!

1184
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,758
You were hired as bait...

1185
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,969
and on this simple task,
you have betrayed me.

1186
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:04,181
- Do you have an answer why?
- I got five of them.

1187
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,352
One! Two!

1188
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,813
Three! Four!

1189
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,690
Just one more. Five!

1190
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:23,742
That didn't... Hurt.

1191
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,792
How do I stop this?

1192
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,046
My hat.

1193
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,014
I guess you never fucked
with nobody from Hoboken before.

1194
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:48,142
- Hudson!
- Anna...

1195
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,227
we're supposed
to be saving you.

1196
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,771
I'm sorry.
I got bored, so I saved myself.

1197
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,606
We still gotta get
them crystal pieces, don't we?

1198
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:56,066
Got them right here, cowboy.

1199
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,734
"Got them right here, cowboy."

1200
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:00,070
- Eddie!
- Sounds like Tommy.

1201
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:03,490
Tommy!

1202
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,618
Alfred, I won't be needing
the car anymore.

1203
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,205
Ta-ta!

1204
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,544
Tommy!

1205
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:19,173
Eddie!

1206
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,680
My pension!

1207
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,778
- Friend of yours?
- Dead!

1208
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,919
Hudson, look...

1209
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:58,253
Out.

1210
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,606
- Minerva.
- Anna! Hawkmeister!

1211
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,276
You're probably wondering
why you're still alive.

1212
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:25,113
We're still having a little problem
putting this damn crystal together.

1213
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,575
Alfie and I have
been at it all night.

1214
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,411
Well? What are you waiting for?

1215
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:44,716
- Don't do it, Hudson.
- Relax.

1216
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:49,012
Besides, we don't
have much choice, do we?

1217
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:20,335
Oh, Hawk, don't ever change.

1218
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:27,551
Nice Hawk.

1219
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:30,804
Bad Hawk!

1220
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,402
Why is the world jam-packed
with such idiots?

1221
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:50,574
Every schmo has the fantasy that
the planet revolves around them.

1222
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,535
It rains. A car crash stops traffic.

1223
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,079
You say, "How can
this happen to me?"

1224
01:28:56,247 --> 01:29:00,417
But for us, this isn't a fantasy.

1225
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,336
It is a reality.

1226
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:05,464
Oh, yes. If da Vinci
was alive today...

1227
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,966
he'd be eating
microwave sushi, naked...

1228
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,969
in the back of a Cadillac
with the both of us.

1229
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,971
The project of his life...

1230
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,849
is now the toy of mine.

1231
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:20,771
History, tradition, culture
are not concepts.

1232
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:24,858
These are trophies I keep in my den
as paperweights.

1233
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,153
The chaos we will cause the world
with this machine...

1234
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:31,740
will be our final masterpiece.

1235
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:32,792
Go, team, go!

1236
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,459
Yes!

1237
01:29:53,012 --> 01:29:54,221
Now!

1238
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:10,862
Eureka, motherfucker!

1239
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:14,116
Well, you should feel very good
about yourself.

1240
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,368
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1241
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,297
What would happen if I didn't put
that crystal together exactly right?

1242
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,455
What do you mean?

1243
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:24,084
Well, let's just say, for example,
I left out...

1244
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,461
this little piece of mirror here.

1245
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:30,549
- Would that be bad?
- Real bad.

1246
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:31,883
Good.

1247
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,895
Minerva! Minerva!

1248
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,526
Alfred!

1249
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:09,087
- Your turn.
- My turn?

1250
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:12,215
How'd it get to be my turn?
I just killed Darwin and Minerva!

1251
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:15,677
- Definitely your turn.
- Shit.

1252
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:19,931
All right. Just stay over here
and try to stay out of the way, alright?

1253
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:21,933
- Hudson.
- What?

1254
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:31,359
Okay.

1255
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,250
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

1256
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:48,668
Sorry!

1257
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,349
Stop helping me!

1258
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,565
Hey, Alfred...

1259
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,530
you won't be attending
that hat convention in July.

1260
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,413
- My turn?
- Yeah.

1261
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,669
With this dog, now?

1262
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:35,590
Oh, Bunny.

1263
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,010
Ball-ball.

1264
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:45,600
Come on, puppy chow, gotta go.

1265
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,827
Here we go.

1266
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,495
Move your hand! Take it away!

1267
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:23,555
Just hang on.

1268
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:38,486
Oh, Leonardo.

1269
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:42,490
Go, Leonardo!

1270
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,747
Oh, baby!

1271
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,708
Hi, kids.

1272
01:34:03,387 --> 01:34:06,431
- Anna?
- Yes, Hudson?

1273
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:07,891
Can I ask you something?

1274
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,602
Sure.

1275
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,855
Will you play Nintendo with me?

1276
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:18,193
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather play Nintendo with.

1277
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:30,121
Wait a minute.

1278
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:32,248
- What about your boss?
- What boss?

1279
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,000
You know.

1280
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,586
Oh, I think he wants me
to keep an eye on you.

1281
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:39,673
You know, I think he wants you
to keep an eye on me too.

1282
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,175
Because I got criminal tendencies.

1283
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,719
- Can I buy you a cappuccino?
- Yes.

1284
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:47,389
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes.

1285
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,893
I just wish Tommy were here.

1286
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:54,521
No way.

1287
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,897
That's not very nice.

1288
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,399
No way!

1289
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,401
Yes way!

1290
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,364
Did I miss anything?

1291
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,615
Did you miss anything?

1292
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,742
You're supposed to be all crashed up
at the bottom of the hill.

1293
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,578
Air bags.
Can you fucking believe it?

1294
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,027
You're supposed to be blown up
into fiery chunks of flesh.

1295
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:15,166
Sprinkler system
set up in the back.

1296
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:18,837
Can you fucking believe it?!

1297
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:21,172
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

1298
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,133
Drink your cappuccino.

1299
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,511
Hey. Drink your coffee.

1300
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:41,860
With the world saved and
the secrets of da Vinci protected...

1301
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:44,821
