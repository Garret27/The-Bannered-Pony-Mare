her parents?

[breathes deeply]

562
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:40,949
I'm draining his fluids
so when I cut him into pieces,

563
00:47:41,084 --> 00:47:42,324
it won't be messy.

564
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,523
Why do you have to cut him
into pieces?

565
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:47,557
[sighs] I have to get rid
of the body.

566
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:50,823
Why don't you just
put it in my room?

567
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,902
Let the monster eat him.

[breathes deeply]

569
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:00,669
Have you ever been to a butcher?

570

Yes.

571
00:48:02,937 --> 00:48:05,713
What I need to do is like
what they do with pigs and cows

572
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,174
at the butcher,
but with a person.

573
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,752
Only we're trying to get him in
a suitcase, not our stomachs.

574
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:14,814
- I love pigs.
- Ah, a cow, then.

575
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:19,058
So anything you're comfortable
with being done to a cow,

576
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:21,595
you should be fine with me
doing to this guy.

577
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,163
- Can I watch?
- No.

You can't tell
he's people anymore.

You can help me
wrap up the pieces,

if you want.

A killer.

589
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:17,885
Did he come to kill the monster?

590
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,380
Oh, you have to stop
talking about monsters.

591
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:22,590
A monster
didn't eat your parents.

592
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:24,224
Your parents were killed.

593
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,726

He came to kill me.

597

Or you.

598
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:46,943
He came to kill one of us.

599
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:48,450
Me, for my reasons.

600
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,184
You, for my mistake.

601
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,187
Why would he wanna kill me?

602
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,955
There was no monster
in Chinatown.

603
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,192
Those were men.

604
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:03,293
A monster
didn't kill your parents.

605
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:05,634
Those were men
who wanted to kill me

606
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,194
because of monsters I've killed.

607
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,171
Monsters who were men.

608
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,337
You don't have to feel bad
because a monster

609
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,307
- ate my parents.
- Stop saying that.

610

Just 'cause you don't want it
to be that way

611
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:19,944
doesn't mean
it's not gonna be that way.

A monster will always eat
my parents,

Yes.

Hello, Aurora.

Hi.

629
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,097
We had an appointment.

630
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,660
We did?

631
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:15,263
If you'd like,
I can give you a few minutes

632
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:17,073
to get yourself together.

633
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,841
This isn't coming together
anytime soon.

634
00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:23,673
We'll have to reschedule.

635
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:27,379
It's challenging being a parent.

636
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:30,416
[Brenda] Hmm. Particularly
being a foster parent.

637
00:51:32,753 --> 00:51:33,922
Yeah.

638
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,392
Particularly...
being a foster parent.

family to come into her life
since what happened.

You're her third foster family.

646
00:51:55,705 --> 00:51:58,045
They did go over that
with you, right?

647
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,781
- And you do know that?
- Yes. Of course.

648
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:04,318
Of course, I'm-I'm speaking
in that we're the first family

649
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:08,815
to come into her life
since the last family did so.

650
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,656
And I've always been--
[coughs] I'm sorry.

00:52:13,522 --> 00:52:14,720
I'm under the weather.

We are all under
the weather here.

653
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,933
You shouldn't come any closer,
or inside.

654
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,767
I was hoping I could use
your restroom.

655
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:22,061
- No.
- [door creaks]

656
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:27,435
I should tell you
and I hate to tell you this

657
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,076
because I know how it sounds,

658
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:32,145
but if you fail to keep
your appointment,

659
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,777
it does go
on your permanent record.

660
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,011
Brenda, you know
how that sounds,

661
00:52:38,147 --> 00:52:41,817
- and you still said it anyway.
- I know. It's not a threat.

662
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:45,353
I know. Let's reschedule.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

- Bye-bye.

How many of your families
has this monster eaten?

00:53:28,837 --> 00:53:29,872
All of them.

674
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,637
All of them?
And no one believes you?

Nope.

Children are scientists.

You don't play, you experiment.

Gather data. Analyze.

- I know what's real.
- No.

You think you know.

00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,328

Where did your monster
come from?

690
00:54:10,406 --> 00:54:11,676
I wished for it.

691
00:54:13,808 --> 00:54:15,548
I wished on a shooting star,

692
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:19,084
like I wished for you
to kill it.

693
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:24,084
Wishing isn't scientifically
sound, evidence-based thinking,
little girl.

Why did you wish for it?

697
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,544
I wanted it to eat my parents.

698
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:47,646
Why did you want a monster
to eat your parents?

699
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:51,243
They weren't very nice to me.

700
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:54,948
You're mad at Mom and Dad.

701
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,485
You wished they'd go away
so you wished a wish

702
00:54:57,621 --> 00:54:59,119
you wish you hadn't wished.

703
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:04,058
All your parents
weren't very nice?

704
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,599
Some of them were nice.

705
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:09,338
Then why did the monster
eat them?

706
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,770
It was trying to eat me.

708
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:18,512
What have you done, hmm?

Have you seen something
you shouldn't have seen?

710
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,480
What makes you so tasty, Erora?

711

- Aurora.
- Arora.

- Aurora.
- Erora.

713
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:34,154
- Aurora.
- Yes. Aurora.

714
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:39,600
I'm wicked.

715
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,601
Who said you were wicked?

716
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:45,267
It knows I'm wicked.

717
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:50,676
It keeps eating my family
'cause I don't deserve a family.

718
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:54,047
I've met wicked.

719
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:56,110
Trust me, you're not wicked.

720
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,489
Where's your monster now?

[grunts]

723
00:56:18,602 --> 00:56:20,500
It sleeps during the day.

724
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:21,806
Under your bed?

725
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:25,039
Under the floor under my bed.

726
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:28,744
It mostly comes out at night
and tries to eat me.

727
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:31,418
It won't stop
until it does eat me.

728
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,049
So you should kill it
before it can do that.

729
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:37,387
Did you try wishing it away?

730
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:39,593
It didn't work, obviously.

731
00:56:41,056 --> 00:56:44,565
- [grunting softly]
- [bed creaking]

732
00:56:48,237 --> 00:56:50,400
Say I do kill your monster.

733
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:52,936
Then what? Where do you go?

734
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,370
There are places where children
in your position usually go.

735
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,372
If they catch me.

736
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:05,949
You don't have any other family?

737
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,017
No.

738
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:10,591
Do you?

739
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,892
No one who'd miss you
if you were gone?

740
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:17,565
No.

741
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,297
They were all eaten.

742
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:21,932
[somber music playing]

743
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:25,364
Anybody who'd miss you
if you were gone?

744
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,143
I'd miss you if you were gone.

745

00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,285
[door clacks]

747
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:57,132
- What's in the suitcase?
- "Who's in the suitcase?"

748
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,608
- Is it the little one?
- That's the big one.

749
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:03,174
This is the little one.

750
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:05,008
He killed her.

751
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,013
You killed him.

752
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:08,246
[suitcase thuds]

753
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:09,850
Return to sender.

754
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,643
I sent two.

755
00:58:12,312 --> 00:58:14,490
I only saw the one
you sent to kill me.

756
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,618
Lapsang souchong.
You want some?

757
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:21,090
Yes, please.

758
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,333
I didn't send anybody
to kill you.

759
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,499
Now, I'm asking you
to be honest.

760
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:31,705
Who was trying to kill whom

761
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,541
and is there an argument
to be made for self-defense?

762
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,975
Because nobody
was supposed to kill you.

763
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:42,543
I may have thrown
the first... what have you.

764
00:58:42,678 --> 00:58:44,011
Mmm. [inhales]

765
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,449
Well, I really was just
trying to help.

766
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:50,658
I saw the gesture
as a professional courtesy. Mm.

767
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,529
I thought I was being
magnanimous.

768
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:56,363
Sending someone
to kill a little girl?

769
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,697
Sending someone
to kill a witness

770
00:58:58,832 --> 00:59:01,702
who knows your face
and knows what you do.

771
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:04,373
If you wanna judge me
on the ease

772
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,803
with which I can kill a child,
have at it.

773

I am eating
a suckling pig tea sandwich.

774
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:14,209
I was navigating
that little girl.

775
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:16,076
You seem triggered.

776
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:18,418
That little girl
clearly triggered you

777
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,212
with the cheetahs
and the baboons.

778
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,986
At least this way,
the deed would be done

779
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:26,155
and you could suppress
or wallow however you chose,

780
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,092
but it would be one less thing
for you to worry about.

781
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:35,395
You're welcome.

782
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:38,904
Thank you.

783
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:41,775
You're welcome.

784
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:44,169
Genuinely, this time.

785
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:47,378
That first one
was mostly sarcasm.

to the second package I sent?

[Intriguing Neighbor sips]

789
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,857
Did you kill her too?

790
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:01,196
What am I gonna tell
these people's families?

791
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,528
I never saw the second package.

792

Monster under the bed get her?

793
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:07,867
Yeah, well... [chuckles]
Yeah. Yeah.

794
01:00:08,899 --> 01:00:10,969
No one has heard of the parents.

795
01:00:11,705 --> 01:00:13,198
No one knows anything
about them

796
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:16,073
beyond the most tedious
of details.

797
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:20,946
Wasn't even their daughter.
Fostering to adopt.

798
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,579
What happened
to her birth parents?

799
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:24,885
They abandoned her.

800
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,979
Packed up and left her behind.

801
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:29,617
Do you see a pattern?

802
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,152
I see a pattern.

803
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:34,157
I think we know
who the real monster was.

804
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:39,162
I kill monsters.

805
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:41,994
No one followed you home.

806
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,667
No one knows where you live.

807
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:45,502
Although, I would move anyway.

808
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:48,402
And I found out
who's trying to kill you.

809
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,407
Who?

810
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:56,408
- Everybody.
- [grunts softly]

811

It's remarkable.

01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,089
And in your line of work,
inevitable.

813
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,915
So, congratulations.

814
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,419

- "We"?
- [footsteps approach]

I told you
to wait for me at home.

823

You weren't coming home.

824
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:30,715
You were gonna leave me.

825
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:33,550
That does seem to happen
to her a lot.

Aurora, do you know
that there are cultures

833
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,722
who won't even acknowledge
someone your age is a person?

834
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:10,016
Delayed personhood,
they call it.

835
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:11,592
You're just a little body

836
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,593
with a soul
slowly growing inside of it,

837
01:02:14,728 --> 01:02:16,923
eventually becoming a person,

838
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:19,666
but not a person yet.

839
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,699
So you should let
the real persons talk.

01:02:21,835 --> 01:02:24,905
- I am--
- Nope. Shut your mouth.

is not little you,

will not fix you.

that you can't truly work

of your own.

all the way to the station.

[exhales]

857
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:15,923
To kill the monster
under her bed.

The monster that ate
her foster parents?

859
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:22,055
And her birth parents.

860
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:24,089
And, well, all her parents.

I don't know
what to do with this.

01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:35,173
You see?

01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:39,240
Who killed the lady with a gun

868
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:40,979
who crawled through
your bedroom window?

869
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:43,016
- I never saw her.
- The monster under my bed.

with a monster

Everybody, the everybody
that's trying to kill you,

they're never going to stop
trying to kill you

01:03:56,932 --> 01:03:59,431
until they've killed you
or you've been killed.

I have two problems.

you're one of them.

You could just be my dad.

You'd be a good dad.

01:05:20,575 --> 01:05:21,943
I don't wanna be
one of your dads, Erora.

and realized,

she's not, really.

So, whatever you think
you want or need from me

908
01:06:00,514 --> 01:06:01,712
isn't really what you think,

909
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:03,487
it's what your brain
wants you to think.

910
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:06,718
And whatever I think I want
or need from you...

911
01:06:06,854 --> 01:06:09,130
It's just what your brain
wants you to think?

912
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:10,493
Exactly.

913
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:12,825
We don't really know each other.

- I wished for you.
- Yes, you did that.

916
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,599
But you didn't actually control
any of that happening.

917
01:06:20,734 --> 01:06:22,842
- Yes, I did.
- No. No, you didn't.

918
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:24,807
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

919
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,279
- I did.
- Nope.

[sighs]

921
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:30,144
- I did.

May I sit down?

01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:41,326
I wouldn't if I were you.

- Is she your daughter?

927

- Yes.
- No.

[exhales]

929
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,345
I hate to question
your parenting--

930

Then don't.

- I assume I'm why you're here.
- You are.

01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:30,969
She is not.

940
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,086
[gulps] You can just ignore her.

941
01:07:43,353 --> 01:07:45,588
Maybe we could talk outside.

942
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:48,096
We just got our food.

943
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,695
Her being here won't stop them.

944
01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:56,830
They will go right through her.

945

No one knows I've seen you yet.

01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:06,037
[whispers]
Shouldn't you tell them?

947
01:08:08,642 --> 01:08:10,447
Tell you what. [clears throat]

948
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:13,117
While she's having dessert,
I'll join you outside.

949
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:15,387
We'll discuss
what we need to discuss.

950
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:19,226
How we need to discuss it.

951
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:21,096
How about that?

You're gonna let
the monster get him?

A monster.

I apologize for this morning.

I hope it all makes sense
once I explain.

- You weren't under the weather.
- No.

Is it lava?

01:10:51,242 --> 01:10:52,674
No, it's not lava.

974
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:55,246
A monster will eat you
if you touch the floor.

- [Brenda] Oh!
- [footsteps tap]

976
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:59,111
I'll consider myself warned.

You'd be the first.

- [Intriguing Neighbor] Erora.
- Aurora.

- [Intriguing Neighbor] Aurora.
- Aurora.

980
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:08,360
Exactly what I said.
Probably shouldn't indulge her.

981
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:10,361
She thinks a monster
ate her entire family.

982
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:12,894
A monster did eat
my entire family.

983

Just grab one thought
out of the air.

01:12:07,113 --> 01:12:09,350
Grab it as it passes
over your head

992
01:12:09,485 --> 01:12:11,286
and say it out loud.

993
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:14,362
- Grab it and say it.
- [inhales] We're all gonna die.

994
01:12:15,096 --> 01:12:16,329
That's a big thought.

995
01:12:16,464 --> 01:12:18,457
I don't believe
that little girl's family

996
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:19,697
abandoned her.

997
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:21,829
Not her first family.

998
01:12:21,965 --> 01:12:24,133
Not her second.
Certainly not those last people.

[inhales deeply]

1000
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:27,471
I-I don't think
they all just left.

1001
01:12:27,606 --> 01:12:29,872
I think...
I think they're all dead.

1002
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:32,275
- Two families?
- Three.

1003
01:12:32,411 --> 01:12:33,804
I'm not this girl's father.

1004
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,677
I live across the hall, 5B.

1005
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:37,351
- Why did you lie?
- Well, I didn't lie.

1006
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,950
That little girl lied.
She's very good at lying.

1007
01:12:40,853 --> 01:12:43,154
I just met her, and she told me
a monster ate her parents

1008
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,151
and then you rang the bell.

1009
01:12:46,252 --> 01:12:47,721
I believe she believes
there is a monster.

1010
01:12:47,857 --> 01:12:49,559
I don't think
she's lying about that.

1011
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:52,558
She's just delusional.

[inhales] But there is something
doing something

1013
01:12:56,702 --> 01:12:58,472
and you need to do something
about that.

If there is someone
you can call...

1015

circumstances are desperate
and immediate.

1017
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,543
You should tell them
that presently, like, now.

1018
01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:10,877
Because we are in danger
right now.

1019
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,314
You, me,
and that sweet little girl.

- we're in danger?

01:13:17,687 --> 01:13:19,189

[pants] Come here.

1024
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:28,161
They followed her home.
They are watching the building.

1025
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,065
Her foster parents are missing.

1026
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:34,904
It all stinks like fish.

1027
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,743
Hey, it's Bautista.

1028
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,240
Anything going on out there?

[man]<i> Yeah.</i>

1030
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,618
Something's going on out here.

[tense music playing]

- You should get up here.
- [man]<i> Copy that.</i>

1033
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:56,460
I think she saw her parents
getting got

1034
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:58,758
and now it has her
seeing monsters.

1035
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:01,097
And those,
those are the monsters.

1036
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:03,971
She could probably explain this
better in her own words

1037
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,572
because it happened to her

1038
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,601
and it's got nothing to do
with me. [inhales deeply]

1039
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,203
And I'm guessing...

1040

meanwhile, also completely

1041
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:15,582

You gonna get that?

1043
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:22,622
I'm debating.

1044
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:25,317
- You want me to get it?
- No.

1045
01:14:28,293 --> 01:14:29,387
I'll get it.

1046
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:31,993
Get off the floor!

- Why are you here?
- [door thuds]

1052
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,281
There are at least
a half-dozen people downstairs

1053
01:14:55,417 --> 01:15:00,025
whose purpose this evening
is to turn you into a carcass.

1054
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,428
Yeah, well...

1055
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,027
And you led them here,
like the Pied Piper.

1056
01:15:05,992 --> 01:15:07,099
Did you have a flute?

1057
01:15:07,234 --> 01:15:08,866
Not a literal flute.

1058
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,028
This is an ambush.

1059
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:13,336
I know. I'm doing the ambushing.

1060
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:15,266
I'm the bushwhacker.

1061
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:17,373
And, uh, what they're doing
is less ambush-y

1062
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:18,775
and more of a siege.

1063
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:21,215
Yeah, that kid
ain't gonna survive a siege.

1064
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,647
She's fine.
I've got the FBI inside

1065
01:15:23,782 --> 01:15:25,614
and they're calling in
reinforcements.

1066
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:27,655
I'm just the concerned neighbor,

1067
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,787
5B.

1068
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:30,657
It's perfect.

[both laughing]

1070
01:15:34,628 --> 01:15:36,828
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- [continues laughing]

1071
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,696
Oh, my God. [laughs]

1072
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,068
I've put a lot of thought
into this.

1073
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,128
Really? "A lot of thought"?

1074
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:45,005
How are you quantifying
a lot of thought?

1075
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:47,000
By number or quality?

1076
01:15:47,135 --> 01:15:49,299
Because I've heard
very few thoughts

1077
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:52,742
- and none of them good.
- [breathes deeply]

1078
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:55,647
I'm on the verge
if not over the verge,

1079
01:15:55,783 --> 01:15:59,186
of convincing them
that disappeared families

1080
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,082
