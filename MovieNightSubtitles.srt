1
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,474
Mommy is...
stretchable.

2
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,142
What do you mean by stretchable?

3
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,746
Daddy's hard.
You can't move him.

4
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,215
He gets mad, and that's it.

5
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,278
Mommy gets mad too,

6
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,750
but she's more like putty.

7
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,390
Mm.

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,891
And she gets sad too.

9
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:05,256
That's when it's
the most stretch.

10
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:09,530
Putty, um... I wonder
how is it that you stretch her?

11
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,101
You just...

12
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:16,108
Can I...
Can I talk now? Please?

13
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:17,975
Um...

14
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,840
-Is it okay if Mommy talks?
-Yep.

15
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,108
Okay.

16
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,949
I'm not stretchable.
I'm not putty.

17
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:24,944
Well, that's her
experience of you.

18
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,448
That isn't true.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,710
I try very hard to be in
control of her and everything,

20
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:32,484
but, um, may as well not even
be there at all.

21
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:35,022
Well, perception
is reality, so...

22
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,294
Also, I don't get sad.

23
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,996
You seem sad right now.

24
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:41,560
You do seem sad right now.

25
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:43,768
We're here to talk about
how to get you better.

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,131
All we do is talk about me.

27
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,468
I can be sad. I mean,
I'm allowed to be sad, right?

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,968
Well, of course.

29
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,110
But, um, you must know that
this is all tangled up together

30
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:55,384
and you of all people
should know...

31
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,712
I know. I know, but, um...

32
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,586
this...
this isn't how things...

33
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,689
are gonna get better. Um...

34
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,557
GIRL Mommy, please don't cry...

35
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,718
No, no. I...

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,171
-because then I'll cry.
-Sweetie.

37
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,394
-She...
-Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,696
We want the tube removed. Now.

39
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:17,541
-No, you can't kill me!
-And to do that, we need...

40
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,566
No, she won't do what
she has to do

41
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,234
because she knows
that she has this safety net.

42
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,416
Things are not
stable enough right now to...

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,410
It's clear that we have
different goals.

44
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:28,914
You want her to get better
before the tube can be removed.

45
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,782
I think the tube needs
to come out,

46
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,951
and then she can get better.

47
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,293
We all have the same goal here.

48
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,720
But what I'm learning
as we're talking all together

49
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:42,891
is that you and I need to spend
some time, just the two of us,

50
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:44,295
without her here...

51
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:47,698
to talk about some
serious issues.

52
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,132
I'm gonna need you to

53
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,870
restart the tube feedings
at night

54
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,465
and I need you to start doing...

55
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:56,872
Did you get the kind
with no cheese?

56
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,783
I can't explain this to you
every time, sweetie.

57
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:01,406
They would just laugh at me
and say it's bread, okay?

58
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:05,115
I'll take the cheese off
when we get home, of course.

59
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,512
Is it the kind with the little

60
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,084
green and black things
in the sauce?

61
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:10,919
It's the same kind
we always get.

62
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,153
That kind has the things
in the sauce.

63
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:15,288
I can't... I can't eat it.

64
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,890
Like, can you scrape it off...

65
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:19,203
Do you even want the tube out or
is it just me who wants it out?

66
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,532
You have to be...

67
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,668
Jesus.

68
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:26,535
Oh, poo.

69
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,538
Oh...

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,408
You got your wish. No cheese.

71
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,279
-Did you will that to happen?
-Yeah.

72
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,078
Are you some kind of
witch or something?

73
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,617
Hey, straight to the table.
Actually, no.

74
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,234
Wash hands first,
and then straight to the table.

75
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,092
I don't have to go
to the bathroom though.

76
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,469
No one's making you
go to the bathroom.

77
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,827
I'm just asking you
to wash your hands, please,

78
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,264
like we always do.

79
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,165
Is Daddy coming?
Where's Daddy?

80
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:59,196
Uh, he said maybe bedtime.

81
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,469
When does he go again?

82
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:05,739
He just got back,
so... in a month?

83
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,906
Mommy?

84
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:09,707
Yeah.

85
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,814
I did have to
go to the bathroom.

86
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,650
Okay.

87
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,848
This might take a while.

88
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:19,054
Okay.

89
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,931
Mommy?

90
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,065
Yeah?

91
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,368
The bathroom has water in it.

92
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,570
Okay, well, that's good.

93
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,936
No, I mean on the floor.

94
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,873
Come quickly!

95
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,913
Are you coming?

96
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,452
Mommy!

97
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,618
Oh, my God. What?

98
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:28,726
Why didn't you tell me
as soon as you came in here?

99
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,492
I just noticed...

100
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,194
because I had to go
to the bathroom so bad.

101
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:37,596
I don't like how it
feels on my socks.

102
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:40,570
Where's it coming from?
How deep is it?

103
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,404
Are we gonna die?

104
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,409
Is the house gonna
fall on top of us?

105
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,342
Mommy?

106
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,312
Can you lift me up
and carry me out?

107
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,745
Yep, just
stay there, okay? Hold on.

108
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,680
Mom, why are you leaving me?
Where are you going?

109
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,258
Just please stay on the toilet, okay?

110
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:57,282
No.

111
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,485
Can you please come...

112
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,826
Can you come now?

113
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,953
Oh, my...

114
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,798
Oh...

115
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,601
my fucking God.

116
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,703
Mommy!

117
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,669
Mommy, you're not
telling me what it is!

118
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:15,770
Mommy!

119
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,105
-What's going on?
-What?

120
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,580
What's happening, Mom?

121
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,780
Are we gonna die?

122
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,520
-<i>Hey.</i>
-Hey, yeah.

123
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,722
We just got home,
and you would not believe...

124
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,399
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

125
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,069
No, no, no! Do not come here.

126
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,603
Do not come in here!

127
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,943
Right now, go, go, go!
Right now! Right now!

128
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,077
Go, go, go, go!

129
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,016
Go! Oh, my God!

130
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,027
<i>Nothing is familiar or real.</i>

131
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:20,423
<i>Ever.</i>

132
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:23,327
<i>Every time I feel this way
I get further and further away</i>

133
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,670
<i>from being in myself, and,
like, I can never get back.</i>

134
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:30,106
<i>When you think about time,</i>

135
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,808
<i>how do you see it?</i>

136
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,745
<i>How do I see time?</i>

137
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,413
<i>Um...</i>

138
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,948
<i>Time is a series of things
to get through.</i>

139
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,011
<i>Each goal is a cliff.</i>

140
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,320
<i>There's nothing
at the end of it,</i>

141
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,691
<i>but then it comes,
and there's just another cliff.</i>

142
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,629
<i>I'm so mad at you!</i>

143
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,132
Oh, shit.

144
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,663
Yo, you know about
holotropic breathing?

145
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:43,702
Mm-mm.

146
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,204
Yo, this shit is lit.

147
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,841
Basically, you trick your brain
into thinking it's dead,

148
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,148
and you see
the fucking universe.

149
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,475
You know what I'm saying?

150
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,857
So you won't feel paranoia
and guilt if something's wrong.

151
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,987
I've got a friend who
does Reiki and shit like that.

152
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,054
Nah, see what I'm saying?
This is like hyperventilating.

153
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,255
When you die, they say
you let off this chemical.

154
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:06,089
And when you're dreaming,
you let off the same chemical.

155
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,927
It's sort of like that,
you know?

156
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,731
You make your brain
think it's dead,

157
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,304
but being brain-dead
is still alive.

158
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,635
-Holographic breath work?
-Holotropic.

159
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,335
Tropic. Holotropic.

160
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,413
-Is that real?
-What?

161
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,950
-The... the dead brain thing?
-Oh, yeah.

162
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,851
I mean, shit.
I guess anything could be real.

163
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:35,152
I mean, anything
could be bullshit too.

164
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,523
You know what I'm saying?

165
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:43,328
But you know that feeling
like when you're not...

166
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,905
Yeah.

167
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,843
Oh, you're making fun of me.

168
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,945
-Miss, I don't even know you.
-Right.

169
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:01,181
Okay. Um, yes on these,
but no on the wine.

170
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,722
Why?

171
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,925
The law prohibits me from
selling you this wine right now.

172
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:11,862
But it isn't even 2:00.

173
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,062
It's 1:58.

174
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,097
Right, but...

175
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,364
By the time I ring these up,
it will be past two.

176
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,367
Huh. Um...

177
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,509
I'll just get
the peanut butter cups.

178
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,944
You can put them on my room.

179
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,506
Will do.

180
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,004
I can't talk about this anymore.

181
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,025
I'm telling you. Please.

182
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,892
<i>Hey, hey. Look, if that's
what Dr. Spring thinks is best,</i>

183
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:18,033
<i>then we have to listen
to Dr. Spring.</i>

184
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,057
There is no "we" though.

185
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,598
It's just me. I... I'm...

186
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,799
-It's not fair. I'm telling you.
<i>-Whoa!</i>

187
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,365
<i>Fair? Listen,
I'm working, all right?</i>

188
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,999
<i>I'm dealing with a lot of
assholes. You have no idea.</i>

189
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:29,904
<i>And I cannot do anything about</i>

190
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,239
<i>what's going on there from here.</i>

191
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:35,039
<i>We need to be a team.
You have to go there today</i>

192
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:37,715
<i>and check in and let them know</i>

193
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,354
<i>-that this whole thing is not...</i>
-I know. I know.

194
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,778
The problem with that logic,
though,

195
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:41,927
is that I'm not a housewife.

196
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,448
-I work too.
<i>-Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

197
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,087
Mommy, this hotel food is gross.

198
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,487
-Good morning.
-This is disgusting.

199
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,655
Wow.

200
00:13:51,757 --> 00:13:54,598
You guys look just like twins.
Anybody ever tell you that?

201
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,963
Uh, no.
You're the first person

202
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,700
to notice and/or say that.

203
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:58,896
Everyone says that.

204
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:03,237
-Hey, cutie. Wanna see a trick?
-Yeah.

205
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:06,306
Whoa. How'd you do that?

206
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,180
Mommy?

207
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,844
You should take it.
She's never gonna eat it.

208
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:15,451
Okay.

209
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,988
Am I gonna throw up now?

210
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,222
-Yeah?
-<i>You hung up on me.</i>

211
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:25,056
<i>Look, I know you have
a lot on your plate,</i>

212
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,797
<i>but she's getting better,</i>

213
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,931
<i>and the rest of it
is totally temporary.</i>

214
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,364
<i>The ceiling will get fixed,
I promise.</i>

215
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,068
<i>The sky is not falling.
None of this is your fault.</i>

216
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,970
<i>-I love you.</i>
-I'm sorry. I love you too.

217
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,432
<i>What's so bad about
a hotel anyway?</i>

218
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,608
<i>And while you're there,
take advantage of the pool.</i>

219
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,305
<i>They got a pool, right?</i>

220
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,073
<i>You always said you wish
you had a pool,</i>

221
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,609
<i>so now you have one.</i>

222
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:47,183
<i>Why don't you go? You can
do some laps, lounge a little.</i>

223
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,405
<i>Get a floatie. Kick back,
get a couple of margarita...</i>

224
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,481
Okay.

225
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,925
Did you know that you can
train hamsters to love you?

226
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:55,589
No.

227
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,826
You can train them to love you.

228
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:01,362
Well, I would love if you would
finish your bacon.

229
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:04,695
That way I can tell everybody
you got 100% on breakfast.

230
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:08,636
And once they love you, you can
get them to do everything

231
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,975
including tricks.

232
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,307
Let's start with one bite.

233
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,713
<i>♪ Ring, ding
Ring-a-ring-a-ling-dang ♪</i>

234
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,916
<i>♪ Ring-a-ling-a-ding-dang-do ♪</i>

235
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,014
<i>♪ Ring, ling
Ring-a-ling-a-ding-dang... ♪</i>

236
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:22,916
<i>♪ Keeps him from lovin' you ♪</i>

237
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:38,233
Is the parking guy gonna
get mad again?

238
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:43,101
Double-park! Double-park!
Double-park!

239
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,041
Okay.

240
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,044
Gotta be fast. You know
what happened last time.

241
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:06,426
You've missed the last few weeks
of family sessions.

242
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:08,762
Yeah.

243
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,398
I told you what happened.

244
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,167
Our entire ceiling fell down,
and with all that chaos,

245
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:16,337
and we're living out
of the hotel...

246
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,735
So we need to schedule something
as soon as possible

247
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:22,238
to talk about her goals
and the treatment process.

248
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,877
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

249
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:26,415
Duh.

250
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,517
Yeah.

251
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,752
-Mm-hm.
-Mm-hm.

252
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,521
Oh, you meant now?
Okay. All right.

253
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,924
Um...

254
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:38,156
Well, uh, let me look
at my schedule.

255
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,764
I should probably do that...

256
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,558
I know that you already
know this,

257
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,936
but you can't start letting
feelings of guilt and control

258
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,271
about this illness
and treatment affect you.

259
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,601
It's no one's fault.

260
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,672
That's right.
That's what I keep hearing.

261
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,348
Also, I really need you to
start taking care of yourself.

262
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,342
Right. Yes.

263
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,912
No.
Put my oxygen mask on first.

264
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,149
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

265
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,693
I'm just gonna have
to get blunt here.

266
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:08,252
So she needs to reach her
weight goal in the next week.

267
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,993
If she does that,
then we can put tube removal

268
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:13,895
and discharge dates on the books

269
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:15,625
but if she doesn't do that,

270
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:18,299
I'm gonna have to reassess
the level of care

271
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,597
because obviously something
is not working here,

272
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,739
and this is what
I need to talk to you about.

273
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,071
When can we sit down properly?

274
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:27,511
Yeah, fine. Uh, September 7th.

275
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,641
It's September 15th.

276
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,184
September 20.
I mean, September...

277
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,153
September 20.

278
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Hey!

279
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,488
Hey! I told you not to do that,
and the next time

280
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,029
I will report you
to the building.

281
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,594
You have no authority
to report me.

282
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,205
You won't be allowed in the lot.
I'll have you towed!

283
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:51,702
Oh, sure! Call them!

284
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,070
I'm not in there long enough

285
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,634
for them to even come!

286
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:56,340
Whatever!

287
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,504
Asshole.

288
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,844
The apartment is
a 30-minute walk,

289
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,548
but it might as well be on Mars.

290
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,882
And I just, I can't...

291
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,047
Every time I go check,
it looks worse,

292
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,482
and I... I have no control.

293
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,214
Have you tried
discussing a compromise

294
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:12,484
with your landlord?

295
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:16,158
Perhaps they could section off
the room with the hole,

296
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:19,223
then you could live freely
in the rest of the apartment.

297
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:22,197
Live freely with asbestos

298
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,736
and 100-year-old dust
and black mold spores?

299
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,268
That's your advice?

300
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,534
It's not advice.
It's a question to consider.

301
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:33,809
I should really show
you this hole.

302
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:38,578
It's an entire nightmare
on my ceiling.

303
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,784
When does Charles return?

304
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,651
This is week three of eight.

305
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:48,318
I mean, you should know that.
Don't you write things down?

306
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,487
It's your job to remember

307
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,860
the boring details
of my fucking life.

308
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,525
We do have to stop now.
We are out of time.

309
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,433
I have another
patient coming, so...

310
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,396
Wait, now?

311
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,969
What about the
ten-minute warning?

312
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,064
Yeah, I just wasn't
paying attention.

313
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,581
You didn't respond to the email
that I sent you about my dream.

314
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:07,075
I don't respond
to my client's dream emails.

315
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:10,406
Okay. So, if you
don't bring it up,

316
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,414
then what is the point?

317
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,384
Okay. Uh, you got me.

318
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,151
I had a dream, and I need
to talk about it today,

319
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:20,958
and I didn't get any time

320
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,224
because you didn't
give me a warning.

321
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:27,657
We can discuss the dream
you emailed next session.

322
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,626
Well, it's actually
a different dream.

323
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,763
-Well, I don't really...
-About you.

324
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,104
-Okay, quickly.
-Okay.

325
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:40,076
I was in a hospital day room

326
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,145
or a recreation room
or something,

327
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,344
and I knew my daughter
was also in the hospital

328
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,644
but... but far away,
another part,

329
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:50,216
and it didn't look like
the hospital

330
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:51,850
she was in last year, though,

331
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:54,290
when everything happened.
It was different. It was weird.

332
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,320
And I was waiting for Charles
to come get me,

333
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:57,795
so we could pick her up

334
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,097
but instead, you were there,

335
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,799
and you wanted to sit
really close to me.

336
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:05,169
And I was, like, inching away
from you on the bench

337
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,532
and you kept inching closer.

338
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,832
And I got my phone
out to text Charles

339
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:12,009
'cause I was nervous he'd
come in and he'd see

340
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,276
and then you tried
to grab the phone

341
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:18,711
and then you started
to tickle me...

342
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,411
to try to get me to drop it,

343
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,281
and I was, like...

344
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,851
I was really enjoying it,

345
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:28,155
but I was so scared that Charles
would come in and he would see.

346
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:32,329
All right.

347
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,129
Okay?

348
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:39,397
All right. You got to tell me.

349
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,305
We'll talk about it next time.

350
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,172
Okay?

351
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:46,003
We won't
talk about it next time.

352
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,006
You know that.

353
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:51,777
There's no thread.
There's no thread at all.

354
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,298
Yes?
What now?

355
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,331
MAN
<i>Hi, yes. So sorry.</i>

356
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,263
<i>Have to leave. Stop work.</i>

357
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:15,668
Uh, what?

358
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:19,270
<i>Mother died. I have to leave.
Work is going to take longer.</i>

359
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:21,572
Uh, okay, uh, just...

360
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:23,006
I'll be one second.

361
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,119
Okay, what is the issue then?
Can you tell me?

362
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,296
This has been going on
for so long.

363
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,326
Do I need to get
a new contractor?

364
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,885
<i>It spread.</i>

365
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:35,066
<i>Uh, it's full. It's very full,
you understand? Very full.</i>

366
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,258
It spread?

367
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,925
<i>Not easy to explain.
Not my language.</i>

368
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:40,956
<i>¡Yo hablo español! Explícame
en tu idiom a, ¡lo entenderé!</i>

369
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:43,497
<i>Sorry, but I don't
understand those words.</i>

370
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,313
How long will you be grieving
for your mother?

371
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,667
<i>I don't say. I don't know.
I can't say.</i>

372
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:49,968
Look, I need a date, okay?
It needs to be fixed.

373
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,568
Just give me a date. My husband
and I will be returning to...

374
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,108
<i>I'll be back, one week.</i>

375
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,478
Okay, well, fine.
I'm going to be going there

376
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,019
and checking on
what you have done so far,

377
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:00,803
and I'm going to be
taking pictures, and I...

378
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:08,755
<i>Vete a la mierda, el cabrón.</i>

379
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:23,737
I can see you now.

380
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,462
I'm really happy to hold this
silent space for you but...

381
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:47,823
as usual, I am curious as to

382
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,697
what you might be
thinking about.

383
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:54,064
Riley.

384
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,540
That's all I can think about.

385
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,578
Tell me what's going on.

386
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,211
Well, I...

387
00:23:04,313 --> 00:23:06,712
I keep telling you, it's...

388
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:09,117
It's like I keep saying
to his doctor, he...

389
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:11,281
He doesn't smile. He...

390
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,950
He looks at me weirdly,

391
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:16,986
and he's just very
uncomfortable all of the time,

392
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,760
and... and no one will do
anything about it.

393
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:23,531
You know what I would love

394
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,435
and what I think would be
extremely helpful

395
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,036
is if you could come
to a session without Riley.

396
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,438
I think it would be...

397
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,115
-I know you think you can't...
-No, I can't.

398
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,739
But I think if you got a sitter
who you trusted, who you could...

399
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:37,308
Did you hear about that nanny
in New York?

400
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,081
The mom came home from work,

401
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,482
and the nanny had stabbed

402
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:43,146
both of her kids to death
in the bathtub.

403
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:47,456
That is real. That happened.

404
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:52,293
A situation like that is
very, very, very unusual, okay?

405
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:53,826
Most people have caregivers

406
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:55,895
-who can trust that...
-I can't.

407
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,797
Well, I... I believe you can.

408
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,831
I just think you don't want to
or you're afraid

409
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,467
so let's stick
to some practical...

410
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:04,200
I need to protect him.

411
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,706
From something specific?

412
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:10,814
Because something
very bad is happening.

413
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:16,982
I'm so... Can I just...
One second. I just have to...

414
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:20,755
This could be about my daughter.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

415
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,960
Um...

416
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:32,801
Yeah. Look, look, I...
I'm not Riley's doctor

417
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,240
so I can't speak to what may
or may not be going on with him.

418
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:39,003
We can only talk
about your feelings

419
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:41,840
about what you perceive
is going on with Riley,

420
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:44,014
which is why I do believe
medication can be...

421
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,948
I'm not perceiving it.

422
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,949
It is happening.

423
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:51,049
And I feel awful about it.

424
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,453
Okay, listen.

425
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:57,488
When you're having
these feelings of deep panic

426
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,329
at home with Riley,

427
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:03,127
just put him in his crib or
carrier or somewhere safe...

428
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:06,432
and draw a bath.

429
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:10,607
Just breathe until your
heart isn't racing anymore,

430
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:13,341
come out and get dressed,

431
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,546
start the day over again...

432
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:18,747
put on some real clothes.

433
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,782
These feelings that
you're experiencing

434
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:26,557
they are...
they're very, very, very scary.

435
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,592
Okay? And very dark.

436
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:33,894
And that's why
you need to keep moving.

437
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:36,659
You need to keep going.

438
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,494
You need to be busy.

439
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,805
You can't sit inside the fear

440
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,368
and doubt

441
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,103
and scariness.

442
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,519
<i>Breathwork is a deep healing
in the nervous system,</i>

443
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:59,256
<i>where we hold trauma
and trapped emotions.</i>

444
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:02,489
<i>We can't talk our way
out of trauma.</i>

445
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,394
<i>The body needs to process</i>

446
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,156
<i>unprocessed emotions
within the body.</i>

447
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:09,797
<i>And this is why breath work
is so powerful.</i>

448
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,368
<i>If you're looking for deeper
ways of healing</i>

449
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,830
<i>and you're searching
for alternatives,</i>

450
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,399
<i>don't wait any longer.</i>

451
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:19,870
<i>Let's connect and schedule
your first breath work session.</i>

452
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:23,010
<i>Directly before the
judge read Ortega her sentence,</i>

453
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,478
<i>she begged for forgiveness
for her unspeakable crime.</i>

454
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,814
<i>She stated she was sorry</i>

455
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,948
<i>for what the judge had called,
"Pure evil."</i>

456
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,387
<i>She then spoke about how
untreated mental illness...</i>

457
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,653
Fuck.

458
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:33,897
<i>-The judge was not convinced.</i>
-Shit.

459
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,241
<i>She will be serving life
in prison</i>

460
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,224
<i>with no possibility of parole,
saying that...</i>

461
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,797
You would not believe
what I have been through today.

462
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,003
Okay, so, I don't
know if you recall

463
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:53,936
but there was this pair of
absolutely davoon-ianca,

464
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:55,344
davoon, gorge leather gloves

465
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,840
that I saw on The RealReal.

466
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:59,509
I wake up this morning, banned.

467
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:02,617
Banned. Yeah. I know.

468
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:03,719
CHARLES <i>Hey, my love!</i>

469
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:04,983
<i>So you been keeping up</i>

470
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:06,633
<i>and eating,
and doing all the right things?</i>

471
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:08,325
Yeah, I ate some cheese today!

472
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,558
-Mmm.
-<i>Cheese!</i>

473
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,702
<i>That's fantastic.
I love cheese!</i>

474
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:12,086
-Daddy, can I get a hamster?
-No.

475
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,575
I already told you,
you're not getting a hamster.

476
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,874
<i>No, no. You know what,
let's see, okay?</i>

477
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,205
<i>Maybe when we get
back to the apartment...</i>

478
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,610
No, no, no, no, no.
She's not getting a hamster.

479
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:18,643
Daddy, when are you coming home?

480
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,900
She's not getting a hamster.

481
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,999
What, where are you?
I can hear something weird.

482
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,907
<i>Oh. Yeah, that.
I'm catching a game.</i>

483
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,408
-A game?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

484
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,907
<i>Yeah, we got here this morning,</i>

485
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:29,439
<i>and there's a
minor league team here</i>

486
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,210
<i>on the island where we go.
It's a little loud, so...</i>

487
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:34,155
Oh, it must be nice, huh,
doing things for yourself.

488
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,812
-What's that like?
<i>-Hey, hey, hey.</i>

489
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:37,082
<i>You wanna switch places?</i>

490
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:38,533
<i>You don't know
what I'm dealing with here.</i>

491
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,799
<i>All right,
I'll go sit on my ass...</i>

492
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:41,386
-Daddy!
<i>-All day in therapy...</i>

493
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:43,155
<i>I'm sorry. Ha-ha.</i>

494
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:45,955
<i>I mean, "sit on my butt"
listening to people whine,</i>

495
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:47,957
<i>and you can captain this fu...</i>

496
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,800
<i>Uh... this stupid boat, okay?</i>

497
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,998
<i>Listen, I'm allowed
to do things on my time off.</i>

498
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>-Jesus Christ!</i>
-Time off? Oh, okay, um...

499
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,534
Daddy has to go now,
and, uh, we have to drive,

500
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,247
-so say goodbye to Daddy, okay?
<i>-No. I don't have to go!</i>

501
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:02,009
<i>-Look, they're in the middle...</i>
-Jesus.

502
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:06,045
I told you, it's a rodent,

503
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,825
and just something
to look after for no reason.

504
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,654
Please, please don't ask again,

505
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,596
and don't ask Daddy things
I already say no to.

506
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:15,286
But Mommy, it's not fair!

507
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,858
Dr. Spring said this
is a big week.

508
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,663
-Did she tell you that?
-Yeah.

509
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,195
I think you can do it.

510
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:00,801
But I'm already doing
it my best.

511
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:03,474
I know, but you have
to do a little better

512
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,067
then we can
get rid of this thing,

513
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,942
and everything will be okay.

514
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:09,879
I'll be better.

515
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,344
Okay. Well...

516
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,121
it's not up to me.

517
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,888
It's up to you.

518
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:28,330
What book can I read
you tonight?

519
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,563
I'm too tired.
Just a song.

520
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,265
Okay, what song?

521
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,005
-The dead whale one.
-Okay.

<i>I don't mean to say

538
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:27,657
<i>but I wonder
if you had been raised</i>

539
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,692
<i>the way your mother
had been raised.</i>

540
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,504
<i>I mean, she had a father
who just took off,</i>

541
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,762
<i>didn't come home.</i>

542
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,437
<i>Then another man
entered her mother's life,</i>

543
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,996
<i>and she became attached to him,
and he bailed out.</i>

544
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:38,295
<i>I know what you're saying.</i>

545
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,133
<i>I did have that same one.
Very similar.</i>

546
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,171
<i>But...
Okay, well, my question is</i>

547
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,906
<i>if you had been raised
as your mother had been raised</i>

548
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:47,215
<i>do you think
you probably would've</i>

549
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,738
<i>knocked your kids around too?</i>

550
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:50,522
See how many
you catch in your mouth.

551
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:51,206
Okay.

552
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,483
Okay, open.

553
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,684
Wait. Shh.

554
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,066
Fuck.
This fucking drunk bitch...

555
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:03,360
Put this on my room, please.
It's definitely before 2:00.

556
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,897
I'm gonna need to see
your ID, ma'am.

557
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,061
You've never asked
me that before.

558
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,964
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to see your ID.

559
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,230
You really want me to go

560
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,038
all the way back up to my room,

561
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,010
get my ID, and come
all the way back down here?

562
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,908
It's the rule. Aren't you only
on the second floor anyway?

563
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,781
When is this the fucking rule?

564
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,353
I have been in here
every single night...

565
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:27,657
Maybe I cracked open
the rulebook

566
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,051
and found some shit out.

567
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,994
Well, maybe you should
find my ID that's behind...

568
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:32,084
Ladies, ladies, ladies...

569
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:33,655
-It's the rule, ma'am!
-Ladies!

570
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,824
-Ladies!
-I'm not going back!

571
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:37,521
Ladies, whoa, whoa!

572
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:40,627
-Ladies, calm it down, bro.
-I'm fuckin' chill.

573
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:41,729
It's not that deep.

574
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,630
She fucking barking at me.

575
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:44,128
Just use my ID for it.

576
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,999
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

577
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:48,134
I can't use your ID
for her wine.

578
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:51,634
Well then it's my wine,
she's just paying for it.

579
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,308
She fucking took it.

580
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:05,722
Hey!

581
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,026
What?

582
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,525
The name's Jamie, by the way.

583
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,430
Got a light?

584
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,562
I'm not interested.

585
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:22,005
-In what?
-I need to be alone.

586
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,173
Rude as hell.

587
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,342
A motherfucking thank you
would've been nice, miss.

588
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,313
I'm, uh, at the hotel.

589
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:11,319
I'm outside just getting
some fresh air.

590
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,955
<i>I don't like it when
you leave her there by herself,</i>

591
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,684
<i>even for a second.
It isn't safe.</i>

592
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,323
I'm just outside for a minute
getting some air.

593
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:21,229
The windows don't open in there.

594
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:23,831
To stop everyone from killing
themselves, obviously.

595
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:25,364
<i>All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>

596
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:26,713
<i>but what if she wakes up
and she's scared or...</i>

597
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,069
Well, she never wakes up,

598
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,881
and anyway,
I have someone at the hotel now.

599
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,204
-A babysitter.
<i>-Really?</i>

600
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:33,476
<i>Where'd you find a babysitter?
Who is it?</i>

601
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,636
His name's James.

602
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:38,044
<i>His name is James?
He's a male babysitter?</i>

603
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:41,217
Did you call just to call
me a bad mother, or what?

604
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,424
You have no idea what it's like
not to be able to go outside

605
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:45,020
even for a minute, by yourself.

606
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,822
You can go outside
whenever you want to.

607
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,858
You can go wherever you want to.

608
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
The machine
doesn't fucking stop...

609
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:51,620
and there's nothing to do in...

610
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,243
<i>Hey, I am over here
working my ass off!</i>

611
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,540
Oh, my God! Who is the one who
went to a baseball game today

612
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:58,096
and who is the one who filled
her bag with gloop 500 times,

613
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:59,694
saw patients, picked her up,

614
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:01,903
had to do dinner where
she only got 20 percent,

615
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,147
and then had to
try to convince...

616
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,606
<i>Can we please not do this?</i>

617
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,734
Look, I gotta go.

618
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,870
The reception's really bad here.
Everything's fine.

619
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:10,172
<i>No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Did you go to the apart...</i>

620
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:29,962
Yes. Yes.

621
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:31,794
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

622
00:34:57,523 --> 00:34:59,827
Here are pics of hole.

623
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,029
Forgot to send today.

624
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,825
I went during lunch.

625
00:35:57,218 --> 00:36:00,619
What is movie...

626
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:08,223
babies, zombies,
'80s, mothers eating babies?

627
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:10,359
<i>Here's what I found.</i>

628
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,868
<i>A court has reopened...</i>

629
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:16,471
<i>nine-week-old baby really
was taken and killed by a dingo</i>

630
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:20,175
<i>24 years after Meryl Streep
portrayed the Australian mother</i>

631
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,638

632
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,676
<i>Chamberlain has

633
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:56,246
What?

634
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,774
Mom?

635
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,732
Hello?

636
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:44,517
<i>Wake up, Mom. Wake up. Okay.</i>

637
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,919
<i>Mom. Mom. You hear us?</i>

638
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,796
<i>Come on, Mom. Snap out of it.</i>

639
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,300

641
00:39:03,902 --> 00:39:05,870
Hey. Hey, you know
what would be super fun

642
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:08,504
and like a really, really
big kid type of thing to do?

643
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:09,739
I can't hear you.

644
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,411
I said, you know
what would be super fun

645
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:14,211
and a big kid
type of thing to do?

646
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,382
What?

647
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:16,727
If I drop you
in front of the door

648
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:18,232
and you just go in by yourself.
Oh, my God.

649
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,387
-That would be so cool of you.
-No.

650
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,822
-Why not?
-All the moms walk you in.

651
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:25,857
You're a mom. You have to walk
me in. You have to sign me in.

652
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,329
Eva! Eva!

653
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:32,334
Can you walk her in today?
Please, please, please?

654
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,898
I cannot deal with the parking.

655
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:36,401
Of course. No problem.

656
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:37,702
-No problem.
-Thank you.

657
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:39,418
Okay. Exciting news.
Guess what? Guess what?

658
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:42,612
Eva will walk you in!
Go, go, go.

659
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,047
Let's go!

660
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,358
-Mommy, Addie scares me.
-Come on.

661
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:48,417
She only eats Nutella.
I need you!

662
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,053
-To be with you!
-Honey, please. For Mama, okay?

663
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,355
-Please? Please?
-You are my mom.

664
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,034
We'll go look at hamsters
today if you do it.

665
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,192
"Look" at them?

666
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,694
I'll get you one, okay?
Just go. Go!

667
00:39:58,494 --> 00:39:59,701
Okay, see? I love you!
I love you, okay?

668
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:01,292
Everything's gonna be...
Shit.

669
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:02,560
-Hi.
-Hi.

670
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:04,464
Shit! Shit! Shit!

671
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:07,365
I'm the worst.
I'm the fucking worst!

672
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:10,969
And then you told me
that if you touch a baby bird,

673
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:14,510
the mama bird will not come back
if they know you touched them.

674
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:18,442
Hm. That must have been
some dream.

675
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,010
-Do you...
-I'm not done.

676
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:22,617
You kissed me.

677
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,456
I said, you kissed me.

678
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:32,193
Yes. I heard you.
In your dream, I kissed you.

679
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:35,157
Yeah, and then the
next day, I felt...

680
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:38,729
crushing guilt.

681
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:40,563
And I knew somehow
that your husband

682
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:42,032
had called me an asshole.

683
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,570
You know, Stephen,
we can talk about these feelings

684
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:48,940
apart from your dreams.

685
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:53,212
But...

686
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,118
I can't help it if in my dreams
you always want to kiss me.

687
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,259
What's the difference

688
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:13,431
between going outside on hotel
property when she's sleeping...

689
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,533
and going all the way home?

690
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:18,370
In one, I guess
I'm just a regular mom

691
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:19,637
making a shitty choice,

692
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:22,275
and in the other,
I'm a... I'm a...

693
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,508
a straight up shitty mom.

694
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,748
Well, it's not my role

695
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,450
to decide whether you should
or whether you should not...

696
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,217
-That's not...
-No, no, no. I shouldn't.

697
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:32,717
I know I shouldn't.

698
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,819
I shouldn't even leave
her for a second.

699
00:41:34,922 --> 00:41:38,720
I mean, it is your job to say.

700
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:41,129
Just tell me not to do it.

701
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:42,894
Just tell me what to do.

702
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:46,496
I don't think you want me
to tell you what to do.

703
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:47,697
You know what to do.

704
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,239
No one will tell me what to do.

705
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,648
I'm supposed to know
how to fix this.

706
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:52,441
I'm supposed to know
how to fix her.

707
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,711
What is it you think
it's your job to fix?

708
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,809
She has to weigh 50 pounds
by next week, Dr. Spring said.

709
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,010
That's a gain of 2.5
pounds, right?

710
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:03,213
Each day's supposed to be
2,500 calories in

711
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,051
compensating for her resting
rate at 1,800 calories burned.

712
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:08,955
That's gotta be at least 80%
of each meal for seven days

713
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:11,620
plus the tube, and that's
if she just lays still all day.

714
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:12,956
And if it doesn't,

715
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:14,924
then something about
not getting the tube out

716
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,693
and reassessing
the level of care.

717
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:18,368
-What do I do?
-Tonight...

718
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,536
I would like you
to get a good night sleep.

719
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,465
So would I,
but I'm asking you a thing.

720
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:26,905
An actual thing, a problem to
fix, and I need help with this.

721
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:28,920
Am I supposed to just sit
around and watch her fail

722
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:31,347
and this is just gonna
go on forever? What do I do?

723
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,512
Okay. That means
there's no drinking.

724
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:35,616
There's no drugs. There's no...

725
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:39,589
Are you listening to me?!
Can you hear me?!

726
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:43,758
I'm asking you what
I'm supposed to do!

727
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,629
Why don't you like me?

728
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:58,067
Why don't I like you?

729
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,171
I know you won't answer me.
Just forget it.

730
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:04,779
That is incredibly unfair.

731
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:10,015
Why is this so important to you
right now?

732
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:19,193
I just want someone
to tell me what to do.

733
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,894
No one will tell me.

734
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,065
I love him,
I love him, I love him.

735
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:29,166
When we get home,

736
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:31,169
he can live a happy life there.

737
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:34,274
And we're gonna have
him forever, and ever, and ever,

738
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:36,245
and ever, and ever.

739
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,982
I love him. I'm gonna kiss him,
and I'm gonna hug him.

740
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,514
Oh, my God. Maybe
his name should be S'mores.

741
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:44,913
That's really nice.

742
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:47,215
I said, don't open the box.

743
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:49,788
I just wanna see him.
He's been scratching.

744
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,127
He doesn't like being
in the box.

745
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:53,421
He's trying to get out.

746
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:56,827
Can you hold it closed, please?
And keep it closed.

747
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,969
He's scratching me!
He's supposed to love me.

748
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:00,928
Close the box.

749
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,567
I can't.

750
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:04,099
Mommy, he's getting out.

751
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,372
Just hand it to me.
Hand it to me.

752
00:44:06,474 --> 00:44:07,708
He's gonna jump out.

753
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,182
-He hates us.
-Give it to me. I can't see.

754
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,040
Give it to me.

755
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:12,355
I think we got
the wrong hamster.

756
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:13,379
Shit.

757
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:16,011
Ow! Shit.

758
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,286
-We're gonna die.
-No, we're not gonna die,

759
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:19,482
but I have to pull over.

760
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:21,050
Ow! Shit!

761
00:44:21,152 --> 00:44:22,328
-Maybe this isn't S'mores.
-Oh, my God.

762
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:24,425
-It's out. It's out! Shit. Shit.
-Oh, my...

763
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:27,395
Mommy. Oh, my God. It's out.

764
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:29,005
Why aren't you
putting that back in?

765
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:30,226
Just put it back in.

766
00:44:30,328 --> 00:44:33,268
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

767
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,632
Please! Put him back in!

768
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't want it.
I don't want him anymore.

769
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:39,474
He's bad.

770
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,673
Okay. Okay, hey, hey, hey.

771
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:46,044
You're fine.

772
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:48,878
You're fine, and I'm fine, okay?
Nobody is hurt.

773
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:51,213
Let's...

774
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:52,633
Take it with you!
Take it with you!

775
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,337
-I'll be right back.
-It's gonna hurt me!

776
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:57,055
I hate my hamster!

777
00:44:57,157 --> 00:44:59,593
-Hey, man. What are you doing?
-Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:01,497
Oh. You're lucky
there's no damage.

779
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,042
We don't have to
exchange information.

780
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:05,105
What? My kid is in that car.
Do you hear her crying, huh?

781
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:06,698
You scared her to death,
you dick.

782
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:09,872
Hey, Mom.
It was barely just a tap.

783
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:12,214
Don't fucking call me Mommy.
She thought we were gonna die.

784
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:14,843
Don't fuck with me
about my child's safety. Huh?

785
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,851
-Give me all your information.
-What the fuck is that?

786
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,946
-What?!
-That! That!

787
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,411
Mommy!

788
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,421
Oh.

789
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:32,822
Mommy, what happened?!
Mommy!

790
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:36,458
I love you.
I miss you. Come back here.

791
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,935
Everything is under control.

792
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,741
Stop.

793
00:45:49,843 --> 00:45:52,513
Do you know that I love you

794
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:55,243
and I think you're the best

795
00:45:55,345 --> 00:45:59,018
and so proud of you
for everything,

796
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,821
and you can do it,
and you're almost all better.

797
00:46:03,924 --> 00:46:05,859
-You're so good.
-Mommy, stop.

798
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:09,657
What? I can't stop.
I just love you too much.

799
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,527
You smell like wine.

800
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,413
Hello?

801
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,950
<i>Hi, it's... it's Caroline.</i>

802
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:35,951
<i>Caroline Primm, your patient.</i>

803
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,854
<i>I'm sorry it's so late.</i>

804
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:41,789
Um... Oh.
Is this an emergency?

805
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,796
Because, um,
if this is an emergency,

806
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,832
you need to hang up and...

807
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:50,131
<i>It's not an emergency. I just...</i>

808
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,842
<i>I forgot to call you yesterday.</i>

809
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,544
What?

810
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:57,877
<i>Well, you told me
to take Riley for a walk</i>

811
00:46:57,979 --> 00:47:00,441
<i>after I took a bath
and calmed down</i>

812
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:02,416
<i>and I did it, and I
forgot to call you...</i>

813
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:05,114
Oh. Okay, yes. Um...

814
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:09,458
Well, uh, that's good,
and, um...

815
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,926
Uh, I... I do feel though that I
should tell you that this number

816
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:17,130
is really for emergencies
only, okay?

817
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:20,461
<i>Oh. I'm sorry. I just...</i>

818
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:22,843
<i>I just couldn't sleep
thinking that you were worried.</i>

819
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,900
I wasn't worried.

820
00:47:25,702 --> 00:47:29,205
<i>You... You weren't?
You weren't thinking about me?</i>

821
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,847
I said that you could
call me if you...

822
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,109
I said you could call me
if you couldn't calm down

823
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:35,783
not that you had to call me.

824
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,682
But, um...
but are you safe, Caroline?

825
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:40,015
Are you...?

826
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:43,887
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.
I... I misunderstood.</i>

827
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:47,864
<i>Yeah, I'm so dumb. Um...
Yes, I'm safe.</i>

828
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:52,367
Okay. Well, let's talk about
this in session, okay?

829
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,900
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm obviously bothering you.</i>

830
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:58,201
It is not your fault, uh...

831
00:47:58,303 --> 00:48:01,243
and I will...
I'll see you next week.

832
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,206
<i>Well, can I come in tomorrow?</i>

833
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:06,744
<i>It's just waiting
until next week seems too long.</i>

834
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,344
Uh, well, let me
check my schedule,

835
00:48:09,446 --> 00:48:12,152
and I will text you a time, okay?

836
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:14,924
<i>Okay. Um, I'm sor...</i>

837
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:23,766
You've gotta be fucking
kidding me! Shit!

838
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:28,467
Hello?

839
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,569
Hello?

840
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:32,037
Hello!

841
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:35,208
Hello! Is anyone here
doing their job?

842
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,448
Shit.

843
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,222
Want some help with that?

844
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,621
I know a trick. Got a knife.

845
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:04,806
Sweetie?

846
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,937
Little Bear, open up.
It's Mommy.

847
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,144
Little Bear, open up.

848
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:20,154
JAMIE What is she doing?

849
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,889
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

850
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:26,191
-What the fuck's your problem?
-What? Whoa.

851
00:49:26,294 --> 00:49:27,767
What, you're obsessed with me
or something?

852
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,637
What are you talking about?
Don't flatter yourself.

853
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:31,573
Well, why are you looking at me?
What? What do you want?

854
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,573
I don't want you just sitting
outside and by yourself.

855
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,744
Some creep might walk past
or something.

856
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,868
What creep?

857
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:37,234
How the fuck do I know, lady?

858
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:38,379
There's creeps
all over this place.

859
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:40,501
-Don't call me lady.
-My bad, miss.

860
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,510
Don't call me miss.
Don't. Just don't.

861
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,006
Ma'am.

862
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:45,745
<i>-Frau?</i>
-Yeah.

863
00:49:45,847 --> 00:49:47,448
-Slag.
-Oh, my God.

864
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,249
Your thottiness?

865
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,252
Housewife?

866
00:49:52,354 --> 00:49:54,427
At this point, I don't even know
what to refer to you as.

867
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:56,256
I'm gonna just call you female.

868
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:58,725
Yo, crazy pants.

869
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,355
I was gonna partake
in surfing the web

870
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,132
for some things that I'm into,

871
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,195
if you catch my drift, and
I'm just putting it out there,

872
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,865
you more than welcome to join.

873
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:11,704
No pressure. Just saying.

874
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,540
What kind of stuff?

875
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:24,346
Is that like the dark web?

876
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:27,956
Like where you can
buy people and stuff?

877
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,725
I don't know.
Never bought a person, so...

878
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,223
But you could? Or sell one?

879
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,865
I mean, I guess so, but
I don't come on the dark web

880
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,898
searching for that
kind of shit, so...

881
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,202
Aren't there places on there

882
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,003
where people, like, show
each other videos of murders

883
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:45,908
and people they're
holding captive?

884
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,842
Can we change the subject?
Let's buy drugs.

885
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,176
Let's get some...

886
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:50,953
some shit, right? Come on.
What do you want?

887
00:50:50,977 --> 00:50:52,279
What are you into?

888
00:50:53,478 --> 00:50:55,713
I don't know.
Do they have, like...

889
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:57,816
cocaine or something?

890
00:50:58,385 --> 00:51:00,683
When was the last time
you tried cocaine?

891
00:51:01,652 --> 00:51:03,622
What do you mean?
It's a very popular drug.

892
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:04,955
I like it.

893
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:10,132
All right. Well, I'm getting
molly, so we'll get both.

894
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,399
See, the thing is,

895
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:14,680
I don't get paid till next week,
so I need you to cover me.

896
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,871
Oh. Oh, I'm... No.

897
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,202
No, no.
I see what this is about.

898
00:51:19,638 --> 00:51:21,478
-Where you going?
-I'm going back to my room.

899
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:23,406
For what?
You don't even have a key.

900
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:25,079
Besides, your daughter's
passed out.

901
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,675
Front desk lady's
definitely in a coma by now.

902
00:51:27,777 --> 00:51:30,953
Calm down. Come sit down.
Let's order. Jeez.

903
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:32,847
I could put it on my
credit card, I guess.

904
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,484
What? No.

905
00:51:34,586 --> 00:51:36,355
The 400, I could put
it on my credit card.

906
00:51:36,457 --> 00:51:38,957
No, no. See, man,
it can't be traced back to you.

907
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,688
It has to be anonymous.

908
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:45,600
Well, then how do you
pay for the stuff?

909
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,234
All right, what we could do is

910
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,256
we could go to a pharmacy
or something real quick

911
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:51,570
and put it on one of
those gift cards

912
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:54,502
or maybe you got Bitcoin, or
crypto, or some shit like that?

913
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:56,172
No, I don't have
any of that stuff,

914
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:58,247
and I can't get in a car

915
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:00,509
and leave my daughter alone
in the middle of the night.

916
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:03,051
You leave your daughter alone
all the time.

917
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,254
No, I don't. That's just
if I go in the field.

918
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:08,624
Ha! I literally seen you leave
your daughter alone myself

919
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:09,618
with my own two eyes.

920
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:11,167
-What's the problem this time?
-What are you?

921
00:52:11,191 --> 00:52:12,590
You stalking me or something?

922
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:15,390
I'm a concerned citizen.
I mean, takes a village, right?

923
00:52:19,866 --> 00:52:20,866
What?

924
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:30,210
Sweetie! Sweetie! It's Mommy!

925
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,648
You locked me out. Sweetie!

926
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,112
Sweetie! Open the door!

927
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:36,317
Little Bear, open the door!

928
00:52:37,215 --> 00:52:38,516
<i>Mommy...</i>

929
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:41,883
Just wheel the machine over
and open the door!

930
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,490
Little Bear!

931
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:48,927
Open the door!

932
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:50,798
I locked myself out!

933
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,864
It's Mom! It's Mommy!

934
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:54,236
<i>Mommy?</i>

935
00:52:54,936 --> 00:52:56,469
<i>Are you there?</i>

936
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,181
I'm not sure how we can
talk about anything helpful

937
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:10,381
if you won't even look
me in the eye.

938
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:12,986
You asked me for this
extra session.

939
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:15,185
I can't.

940
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:17,155
You must be so mad at me.

941
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:18,992
Mad? Oh, because you called me?

942
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,957
No, no, no. I'm not mad at you.

943
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,265
Let's move on. Please?

944
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,204
You have a daughter.

945
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,167
Why didn't you ever tell me?

946
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:34,139
Well, this isn't about me.

947
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:35,970
But now I know that you know.

948
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,176
You know.

949
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,112
I don't know.
You need to tell me.

950
00:53:42,214 --> 00:53:43,879
It's not your fault.

951
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,747
But it is mine.

952
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:50,690
Okay, you know, Caroline I think
that it may be time that we...

953
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:51,887
um...

954
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,864
that we consult with someone

955
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,966
about some medication for you.

956
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:02,197
Well, I can't take medication.
I'm breastfeeding.

957
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,375
-Do you want me to kill my baby?
-Of course not.

958
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:09,712
I just think if a doctor thinks
it could be beneficial,

959
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,643
then maybe we need to...

960
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:17,551
prioritize your... your...
health over breastfeeding.

961
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,380
Just right now.

962
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:22,154
You know, you need to take
care of yourself

963
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:24,018
so you can take care of Riley.

964
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:26,955
I have to go to the bathroom.

965
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:34,468
Um, well, we only have
15 minutes left.

966
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:37,239
I have to go now.

967
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,474
Okay, well, can you wait
till after the session?

968
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,576
No?

969
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:25,915
Oh... Oh.

970
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,889
Shit.

971
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,963
Oh. Okay, okay. Okay.

972
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:50,141
Okay.

973
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:01,456
Caroline? Excuse me.

974
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,360
Caroline?

975
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:12,098
It's okay.

976
00:56:13,763 --> 00:56:16,171
Caroline? Excuse me. Caroline?

977
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,506
I need you
to help me out here. I...

978
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:28,010
Okay. I know. I know.

979
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:40,158
Caroline?

980
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:01,846
Okay. Okay.

981
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,914
Caroline!

982
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,850
Caroline!

983
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,558
Yeah. I know.

984
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:18,759
What is going on here?
I'm in a session.

985
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:20,929
So, my patient,
she has this baby

986
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,766
and she said she was
going to the bathroom

987
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:25,474
and then she left the baby
with me and I...

988
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:27,652
-She's gone. And now I can't...
-I'm with a patient.

989
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:29,549
Please, I need your help.
I really need your help.

990
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:30,872
I'm with a patient.

991
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:33,307
Plus, also,
I'm not your supervisor.

992
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,778
This is a professional issue.
This is not a treatment issue.

993
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,481
Are you joking?
This is an emergency!

994
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,817
Whatever's happening in here

995
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:40,629
is not as important
as what I'm going through here!

996
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:42,222
-Okay, no.
-I need your help!

997
00:57:42,324 --> 00:57:43,432
-Goodbye.
-I need your help!

998
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:44,688
This is an emergency.

999
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,961
-You can come back later.
-Absolutely not.

1000
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:51,566
No!

1001
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:58,103
Okay.

1002
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:02,438
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello?

1003
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,741
Hello. Hello. Yes.

1004
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:05,288
Hello, I am
your wife's psychotherapist...

1005
00:58:05,312 --> 00:58:06,581
<i>Stop, I can't...</i>

1006
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,089
and she left today in
the middle of her appointment.

1007
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:11,817
<i>I cannot hear you.
I cannot hear you. Who is this?</i>

1008
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:17,152
Okay. Yes.
This is your wife's therapist.

1009
00:58:17,254 --> 00:58:19,558
She left in the middle
of her appointment today...

1010
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,191
<i>-All right. You gotta stop.</i>
-And...

1011
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,272
<i>You gotta stop. I have no idea
what you're even talking about.</i>

1012
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:24,765
<i>Who is this?</i>

1013
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,034
Is your wife named
Caroline Primm?

1014
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,867
And you are, um...

1015
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,305
Your baby's name is Riley?
And you are Nick Primm?

1016
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,638
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Okay, yes, right. Well...

1017
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,020
<i>My wife doesn't have
a therapist.</i>

1018
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,511
Okay, well,
she has been my patient

1019
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,040
at The Center for
Psychological Arts in Montauk

1020
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:41,016
since she was about
six months pregnant

1021
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,446
with Riley, and today...

1022
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:45,285
<i>Well, this is news to me.</i>

1023
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,950
Mm. Well, whether...

1024
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:49,732
you knew that she
was my patient or not,

1025
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,020
what I'm trying to say to you

1026
00:58:51,122 --> 00:58:52,766
is that this is an emergency,
and I really...

1027
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,725
She left your baby here with me,

1028
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:56,860
and I need you to come
and pick him up.

1029
00:58:56,962 --> 00:58:59,333
<i>What do you mean?
What do you mean?</i>

1030
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,475
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

1031
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:01,367
<i>She left the baby?</i>

1032
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:02,749
She's not answering her phone...

1033
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,371
<i>She's probably in the bathroom</i>

1034
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:05,840
<i>or by a fucking vending machine.</i>

1035
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:06,636
Okay.

1036
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:07,903
I suggest that you call her.

1037
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:09,381
Maybe she would pick up
if it was you.

1038
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:12,013
I'm gonna text you my address
to come and get the baby.

1039
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,481
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

1040
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,986
I'm sure she's okay.
I'm sure she's okay.

1041
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,910
<i>I cannot even believe this.</i>

1042
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,653
I'm sure she's okay. I'm sure...

1043
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,951
<i>You know what? This is
so fucking typical of her.</i>

1044
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:24,324
Okay. Well, she probably
just needed some space.

1045
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:27,162
I'm gonna text you
my address where...

1046
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,736
-so you can come and get her.
<i>-Okay, look. Listen to me.</i>

1047
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,093
-Him.
<i>-Listen to me.</i>

1048
00:59:31,195 --> 00:59:33,795
<i>I'm at work right now.
I am at work right now.</i>

1049
00:59:33,897 --> 00:59:35,137
<i>That's why she's supposed to be</i>

1050
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,570
<i>taking care of the fucking baby,</i>

1051
00:59:36,672 --> 00:59:39,136
<i>so I can work, okay?</i>

1052
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:41,735
<i>Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna text you my address.</i>

1053
00:59:41,837 --> 00:59:43,238
<i>I'm in Amagansett.</i>

1054
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,917
<i>You can drop the baby off
at this address, okay?</i>

1055
00:59:44,941 --> 00:59:46,977
Okay, well, I can't do that,

1056
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:49,778
and I am actually very
concerned about your wife.

1057
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:51,586
This is an emergency, and she...

1058
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,328
<i>You know, you've used
that term twice now.</i>

1059
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:54,819
<i>This isn't my emergency.</i>

1060
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:56,495
<i>I'm not the one
who lost my fucking wife!</i>

1061
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:59,087
I need you to come down here
and get your baby immediately,

1062
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,840
and if you're not here
within a half an hour,

1063
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,475
I'm going to call the police.
I will text you the address.

1064
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,939
-Thank you very much.
<i>-Oh, Jesus...</i>

1065
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,810
-Yes?
<i>-Hi, it's Stephen.</i>

1066
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:44,299
May I come in?

1067
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,343
I'm expecting a patient.
He just buzzed in.

1068
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:07,561
Would you mind waiting
in my office

1069
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:09,665
down the hall
just a few moments?

1070
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,595
Your office?
Who are you, the boss?

1071
01:01:13,964 --> 01:01:16,130
No. Just another therapist.

1072
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:17,866
I have an office.
It's down the hall.

1073
01:01:17,968 --> 01:01:19,675
Door is open. You'll see it.

1074
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:23,740
This is my time.
She's mine right now.

1075
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:25,709
You can't make me wait, okay?

1076
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:27,744
This is an emergency situation.

1077
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:29,782
You can either wait in my office

1078
01:01:29,884 --> 01:01:31,951
or you need to
leave the building entirely.

1079
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:37,458
Is that a baby?

1080
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,121
Is that your baby?
You have a baby?

1081
01:01:39,223 --> 01:01:41,091
I mean, do you guys
have a baby together?

1082
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:44,659
Okay, this situation
does not concern you, okay?

1083
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:46,229
Make a choice.

1084
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,804
Okay, I'll be in your office.

1085
01:01:54,906 --> 01:01:56,778
But I won't wait that long.

1086
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:03,581
Okay.

1087
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,031
Wow.

1088
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:20,296
Can you believe that
I got talked into getting

1089
01:02:20,398 --> 01:02:24,698
this fucking hamster
after all of that? My God, I...

1090
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:28,376
She's right. I really am
so stretchable.

1091
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,539
-It's disgusting.
-You know...

1092
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:32,506
when I was in medical school,

1093
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:35,912
I had to do a stint
in a medical experiments lab.

1094
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:41,790
And we were testing
the efficacy of a drug on rats.

1095
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:44,725
Oh, I... So cool.

1096
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:49,092
And the way it worked is
we'd take the rats,

1097
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:52,464
and we'd drop them
in this guillotine thingy,

1098
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,666
chop their heads off
individually,

1099
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:59,038
peel the skin back

1100
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,469
and then look at their brains
under a microscope.

1101
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,173
I'm just so curious

1102
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:08,110
about the process with that.
I wonder...

1103
01:03:08,212 --> 01:03:13,079
The rats would claw
and bite you...

1104
01:03:13,682 --> 01:03:17,891
when you put your hand
in the cage to pick them up.

1105
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:23,493
So they gave us
these steel chain mail gloves.

1106
01:03:24,063 --> 01:03:26,568
They're German.
They're beautiful.

1107
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:30,537
So you put on the glove and
you put your hand in the cage,

1108
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:34,106
and the rats would just
attach themselves to the glove,

1109
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:36,872
clinging for dear
life, you know?

1110
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:41,580
And then when you got
to the guillotine box,

1111
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:44,149
you had to shake them off.

1112
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:46,819
Really shake them.

1113
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:50,122
I was always worried
that the rat would get hurt

1114
01:03:50,224 --> 01:03:52,454
when it hit its head on the
guillotine, you know?

1115
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:58,160
But their brains
were always fine

1116
01:03:58,262 --> 01:03:59,793
when we looked under
the microscope.

1117
01:04:03,403 --> 01:04:04,770
Oh.

1118
01:04:04,872 --> 01:04:09,638
Rodents are resilient creatures.

1119
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:18,150
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1120
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,158
I'll tell Stephen
your session's cancelled.

1121
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:30,591
You have to take care
of this, okay?

1122
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,233
I love you.

1123
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,045
Just tell me, was she suicidal?
Homicidal?

1124
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:48,014
No. Mm-mm. No.

1125
01:04:48,116 --> 01:04:50,678
No, she was obsessed
with protecting the baby...

1126
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,520
And, uh, yeah.

1127
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,952
She wouldn't hurt the baby.

1128
01:04:54,054 --> 01:04:55,622
And she didn't talk
about suicide.

1129
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:56,952
She wouldn't abandon Riley.

1130
01:04:57,054 --> 01:04:58,919
She just did abandon him.

1131
01:04:59,455 --> 01:05:01,958
Right, well, you know,
I mean, um...

1132
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:05,032
you know, permanently. Forever.

1133
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:09,063
Is that it?
I have another patient waiting

1134
01:05:09,165 --> 01:05:11,405
who really needs my help.

1135
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,907
It's fine. It's more common
than you think.

1136
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:17,151
A woman tries to run away
from all the responsibilities.

1137
01:05:17,175 --> 01:05:18,705
-Yeah.
-Everybody gets all upset,

1138
01:05:18,807 --> 01:05:20,854
then they come back with
their tails between their legs.

1139
01:05:20,878 --> 01:05:23,481
Okay. Okay.

1140
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:26,086
Thank you, Officer.

1141
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:30,552
<i>When
you have finished recording,</i>

1142
01:05:30,654 --> 01:05:33,186
<i>you may hang up or press one
for more options.</i>

1143
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:34,792
Hi. Hi,

1144
01:05:34,894 --> 01:05:36,027
it's, uh... it's me again,

1145
01:05:36,129 --> 01:05:38,198
your tenant from
22 Algonquin, unit one.

1146
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,328
You know, the one with the giant
fucking hole in the ceiling!

1147
01:05:41,697 --> 01:05:43,871
Your repairs guy ran off,
and it's getting worse

1148
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,699
and I want to know why
you're doing nothing,

1149
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:47,785
and why you're happy for
my daughter and I to be staying

1150
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:49,236
at a flophouse full of freaks

1151
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:50,878
while I continue
to pay you rent!

1152
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:54,081
And I have a very, very,
very important patient

1153
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,263
that is a prominent lawyer,
and I am not afraid to...

1154
01:05:58,849 --> 01:05:59,988
Fuck!

1155
01:06:04,222 --> 01:06:07,289
I was after some
Visa gift cards.

1156
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:09,993
Uh, what denominations
do you have?

1157
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:12,876
Do you have a minute to talk
before the children come out?

1158
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,266
-Mm-hm. Sure.
-Okay, come.

1159
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:20,669
So, I've noticed that you still
haven't made the appointment

1160
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:22,942
for family therapy like
we discussed the other morning.

1161
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:25,609
I know. It's just been
so crazy at work.

1162
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:29,182
Right. So I can't stress to you
enough how important this is.

1163
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:31,850
I'm on your side here.

1164
01:06:31,952 --> 01:06:33,687
Yes. Yes. Yes, I understand.

1165
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,849
We need her off the machine.

1166
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,184
Yeah, so do I.

1167
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:38,819
Okay. I'm gonna be frank.

1168
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,995
We need her off of it as soon as
possible for her to remain here.

1169
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,427
And to do that, she needs
to gain faster.

1170
01:06:44,529 --> 01:06:47,162
Okay. Well, but we have
until next week, right?

1171
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:48,962
-The 50 pound goal.
-No.

1172
01:06:49,064 --> 01:06:52,535
The way things are going, uh,
she's not gonna make that goal.

1173
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,208
What are you saying?

1174
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,977
We do weigh-ins every morning.
She's not gonna make the goal.

1175
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,679
Because the goal you set
was impossible.

1176
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,175
We were set up to fail.

1177
01:07:01,277 --> 01:07:02,512
-It's unrealistic.
-No.

1178
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:06,516
We're gonna have to reassess
the level of care.

1179
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:09,120
What does that mean?

1180
01:07:09,222 --> 01:07:11,251
Well, we can discuss
it in our meeting.

1181
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:15,492
You know what I would love,
and think would be so good,

1182
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:19,899
is if we could get a date
on the calendar for the surgery.

1183
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:22,967
A concrete goal that we can
all work towards.

1184
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,305
It's not... it's not a surgery.

1185
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:28,808
The tube removal? Well, uh...
procedure, whatever you call it.

1186
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,904
It's not a procedure either.

1187
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:34,247
Uh, when it's time to remove it,
the doctor just pulls it out.

1188
01:07:38,048 --> 01:07:39,219
Pull it out?

1189
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,320
Yeah, it just slides out.

1190
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,790
They could just...
really just pull it out?

1191
01:07:44,892 --> 01:07:46,354
Yeah, it's that simple.

1192
01:07:46,456 --> 01:07:49,927
Oh. But what happens
to the hole?

1193
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:52,728
It closes up on its own.

1194
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,296
Oh.

1195
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:57,567
It's kinda like when you
get a cut on your tongue.

1196
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:00,438
It wants to close up.

1197
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:03,741
Oh.

1198
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,419
Yeah?

1199
01:08:13,316 --> 01:08:15,618
Oh, hi. Uh, is James here?

1200
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:18,923
Who are you?

1201
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,100
I'm his neighbor.
I'm there, in that room there.

1202
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,429
He is not here.

1203
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:29,431
Oh, uh, do you know when
he'll be back?

1204
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:31,635
I just have something
to give him.

1205
01:08:31,937 --> 01:08:32,937
Give it to me.

1206
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,215
-I'll see he gets it.
-No, no.

1207
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:36,243
I have to give it
to him myself. It's, uh...

1208
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:38,839
It's of value.

1209
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,516
Of value?

1210
01:08:42,949 --> 01:08:45,450
Uh, yeah. Of value.

1211
01:08:56,163 --> 01:08:57,195
<i>Relax your body.</i>

1212
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:01,433
<i>Center in with yourself.</i>

1213
01:09:06,703 --> 01:09:09,210
<i>Right now, your only
job is to breathe.</i>

1214
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,577
<i>We're in the work phase
of this...</i>

1215
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:17,845
<i>The more you relax
your body right now...</i>

1216
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,752
<i>the easier it gets for you.</i>

1217
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:27,628
<i>Recognize we're accessing
the body's wisdom zone.</i>

1218
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,164
<i>Let your mind go.</i>

1219
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:33,396
<i>See if you can find
your attention</i>

1220
01:09:33,498 --> 01:09:36,165
<i>within the movement
of your breath.</i>

1221
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,365
<i>Start noticing</i>

1222
01:09:37,468 --> 01:09:39,201
<i>any sensation in your body...</i>

1223
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:43,171
<i>and see what catches
your interest</i>

1224
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:45,407
<i>or your curiosity,</i>

1225
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:49,178
<i>and hold the space
in a way you want to be held.</i>

1226
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,546
<i>You'll probably notice</i>

1227
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:54,718
<i>any intensity
builds up in your body.</i>

1228
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:56,582
<i>That's okay.</i>

1229
01:09:56,918 --> 01:09:59,557
<i>Rather than trying
to control anything,</i>

1230
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,727
<i>see if you can just allow...</i>

1231
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:04,358
<i>the intensity to...</i>

1232
01:10:13,635 --> 01:10:15,176
<i>You're not helping!</i>

1233
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:17,240
<i>Hold her legs that way.
Hold her legs down.</i>

1234
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,214
<i>We might have to restrain her.</i>

1235
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:22,677
<i>-Mom!
-Hold her down!</i>

1236
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,478
<i>You're here to help us, come on!</i>

1237
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,282
<i>That's not helping at all.</i>

1238
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,857
<i>Mommy!</i>

1239
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:35,656
<i>Mommy!</i>

1240
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,257
<i>Try to help.
Try to help.</i>

1241
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,832
<i>Mommy!</i>

1242
01:10:47,008 --> 01:10:48,876
<i>Make yourself feel safe.</i>

1243
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:50,704
<i>If things are getting intense,</i>

1244
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:53,212
<i>recognize you can hold the space.</i>

1245
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:55,247
<i>You can love yourself right now.</i>

1246
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:02,450
<i>Don't avoid anything within.
Don't abandon yourself.</i>

1247
01:11:02,552 --> 01:11:04,188
<i>Stay connected to yourself.</i>

1248
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,227
<i>See if you can honor yourself</i>

1249
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:10,062
<i>in this moment
of reconnecting to yourself.</i>

1250
01:11:23,205 --> 01:11:27,414
<i>Use your voice
and imagine your emotion.</i>

1251
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:29,278
<i>Allow it to be...</i>

1252
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,649
Maybe you can even
do it tonight.

1253
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,528
Down here. This way.

1254
01:11:56,805 --> 01:11:58,544
It's in here. Here.

1255
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:06,014
Okay, we gotta be quick because
I have to get back, but...

1256
01:12:06,116 --> 01:12:10,589
I just... I just had to show
someone what's going on in here.

1257
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:12,825
Okay.

1258
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:17,158
So, a room filled
with plastic tarp everywhere.

1259
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,361
Nice.

1260
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,197
So, is this your kill room?

1261
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:22,101
No. Come on, I told you.

1262
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:23,932
The fucking ceiling fell down.

1263
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,433
What the fuck is that?

1264
01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:28,173
That's it. That's the hole.

1265
01:12:28,275 --> 01:12:29,608
That's why I'm at the hotel.

1266
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,417
That's why you're
staying at the fucking hotel?

1267
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:32,743
Oh, my God. Come on.

1268
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,717
You could've slept on your couch
for a couple of weeks.

1269
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:36,977
What? Look at it.

1270
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:39,682
It's been two months,
and they refuse to fix it.

1271
01:12:39,784 --> 01:12:43,921
There's dust and...
and mold everywhere.

1272
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:45,393
Mm.

1273
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:58,934
Yo, what is up there?

1274
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:02,740
They've been renovating forever.

1275
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:06,277
-They said a pipe burst.
-Oh, shit.

1276
01:13:06,446 --> 01:13:09,946
It's right there. There you go.

1277
01:13:10,048 --> 01:13:13,720
I did the... that... you know,
the thing, the breath thing.

1278
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:14,822
What?

1279
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:16,552
And I think it took me here.

1280
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:18,588
-I think maybe I...
-Oh, man...

1281
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,227
That's why I wanted
to come to see it.

1282
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,095
Man, you need guidance
with that shit.

1283
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,358
You can't just be doing that.

1284
01:13:25,127 --> 01:13:27,595
-What are you doing?
-Man, they lied to you, sis.

1285
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:28,875
It ain't even no pipes in here.

1286
01:13:28,899 --> 01:13:30,212
Maybe you shouldn't
get so close to it.

1287
01:13:30,236 --> 01:13:32,202
Shh. Look. Come see.

1288
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:34,236
It's a clean break.
I'm telling you.

1289
01:13:34,338 --> 01:13:35,709
Oh, my God.

1290
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,004
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

1291
01:13:38,106 --> 01:13:41,414
Man, my cousin Craig
is a general contractor.

1292
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,515
He knows somebody
that knows somebody that can

1293
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:45,377
-fix this shit in a jiffy, yo.
-Oh, my God.

1294
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:46,748
It look like you got some

1295
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:48,589
motherfucking debris
on your furniture.

1296
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,550
You know, I can reupholster it.

1297
01:13:50,652 --> 01:13:51,652
It's gonna cost you.

1298
01:13:53,457 --> 01:13:55,121
<i>Let me go!</i>

1299
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:08,135
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

1300
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,680
Mommy! Mommy! I don't want it!

1301
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:18,684
-You are doing such a good job.
-No!

1302
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,085
No! Mommy!

1303
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:25,053
You gotta hold her
a lot harder than that.

1304
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,790
No! No!

1305
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,104
What the fuck?!
Oh, shit!

1306
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:47,013
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1307
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,119
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1308
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:54,516
James?

1309
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,627
Ah! Fuck! Fuck!

1310
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:04,393
Fuck!

1311
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:06,868
Oh, fuck!

1312
01:15:07,397 --> 01:15:08,767
Oh, fuck!

1313
01:15:26,453 --> 01:15:29,153
Everybody settle. All right?

1314
01:15:29,722 --> 01:15:32,353
Get started.
Hand out these, please.

1315
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:33,957
Thank you.

1316
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:37,290
All right.

1317
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:44,505
So the topic today is something
that's so fundamental

1318
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:47,406
that it's actually
a little silly to talk about.

1319
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:52,276
But it is so important
to your child's recovery,

1320
01:15:52,378 --> 01:15:53,909
and more than that,

1321
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:57,577
to your ability
to help your child recover.

1322
01:15:57,946 --> 01:16:00,016
Can anybody guess what it is?

1323
01:16:02,452 --> 01:16:04,354
Blame...

1324
01:16:04,756 --> 01:16:06,888
-and, anybody?
-Shame.

1325
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,491
Yeah, thank you.

1326
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,664
So, as parents, a lot of times

1327
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:16,097
we look too
closely at ourselves, right?

1328
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:19,538
And we start to ask ourselves,
is this my fault?

1329
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,569
Could I have done anything
differently?

1330
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:23,971
What if this? What if that?

1331
01:16:24,073 --> 01:16:28,443
But all it does is create
a thinking trap.

1332
01:16:30,012 --> 01:16:33,284
And that does not
help your child.

1333
01:16:33,753 --> 01:16:36,789
So what I'd like to
do, if we look...

1334
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:39,723
Melanie...

1335
01:16:39,992 --> 01:16:41,832
do you want to put some
words to your feelings?

1336
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,225
Yeah.

1337
01:16:45,362 --> 01:16:46,699
I...

1338
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:50,597
Sometimes, I just think
that it is all my fault.

1339
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,777
Do you have something
to say to Melanie?

1340
01:16:59,446 --> 01:17:02,182
No. Whoa, no.

1341
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,383
Never mind. Don't mind me.

1342
01:17:04,852 --> 01:17:07,017
No, no, no. I want to hear
what you have to say.

1343
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,286
Uh...

1344
01:17:12,388 --> 01:17:15,694
I just... You keep telling us
that it isn't our fault.

1345
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:18,127
-Yeah.
-Mm. But... but it is.

1346
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,462
Excuse me?

1347
01:17:21,564 --> 01:17:23,878
I mean, if it isn't our fault,
then we're really super fucked.

1348
01:17:23,902 --> 01:17:25,143
We're just walking around
pretending

1349
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:26,774
we have power
to change something

1350
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:29,053
that we don't even understand
because it's not our fault,

1351
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,877
but we know how to change it,
even though it's not our fault.

1352
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,308
No, this is actually good.

1353
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,325
This is actually good because
now we have a lot to unpack.

1354
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:36,651
No, no, no. I know.

1355
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:37,927
I can't do this. I have to go.

1356
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:39,630
-Please sit down.
-No, no, no. It's our fault.

1357
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:40,894
It isn't fair,
but it is our fault.

1358
01:17:40,918 --> 01:17:42,556
That's how I see it. That's it.

1359
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,556
That's what this whole
thing is, is our faults.

1360
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:46,591
-Stop and sit down.
-No, no, no.

1361
01:17:46,693 --> 01:17:47,970
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

1362
01:17:47,994 --> 01:17:49,860
I already know it,
and I don't have to meet you

1363
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,370
because I know what
you're going to say,

1364
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:52,877
-which is that she's failed...
-I need you to sit down!

1365
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,866
And that I failed
because you set us up to fail.

1366
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:57,646
No one tries hard
if they have a safety net.

1367
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,638
-Sit down.
-Nobody, okay?

1368
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,081
And you should know
that, Dr. Spring.

1369
01:18:01,105 --> 01:18:02,705
I'm gonna be here
for the rest of my life

1370
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:04,205
pouring shit down that tube.

1371
01:18:04,307 --> 01:18:07,077
-Every night until I die.
-Do not leave that door!

1372
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:10,115
And none of this is helping
any of us. None of it.

1373
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,218
Come back!

1374
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,149
<i>Hey!
Hey, why are you calling?</i>

1375
01:18:15,252 --> 01:18:16,954
<i>Isn't a parent group
going on right now?</i>

1376
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:18,824
<i>I couldn't sit there.
I'm in the car.</i>

1377
01:18:18,926 --> 01:18:20,793
<i>I'll pick her up later,
but I can't stay there.</i>

1378
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:22,101
<i>What do you mean
you couldn't sit there?</i>

1379
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,590
<i>I can't do it.
I can't do it.</i>

1380
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:25,972
<i>She's gotta get better, but
she's not gonna make the goal,</i>

1381
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:28,063
<i>and I... I don't know
what's gonna happen now.</i>

1382
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:29,899
<i>You need to get back in there.</i>

1383
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:31,081
<i>The hole is getting bigger.</i>

1384
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,903
<i>What hole?
Her tube hole?</i>

1385
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:35,142
-No! No, the apartment hole!
<i>-You told me...</i>

1386
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:36,677
The goddamn hole!

1387
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:38,776
<i>Why can't you just keep tabs
on those guys?</i>

1388
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:40,677
Because the guy's gone
for a week.

1389
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:42,376
There's no one working on it.

1390
01:18:42,478 --> 01:18:44,448
<i>What?! A week?! When
were you gonna mention that?</i>

1391
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:45,818
I'm telling you now.

1392
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,092
It's very complicated
to explain over the phone.

1393
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:48,484
<i>Look, look, look. No, no, no.</i>

1394
01:18:48,586 --> 01:18:49,752
<i>Just... just</i>

1395
01:18:49,854 --> 01:18:51,119
<i>-send me pictures...</i>
-No!

1396
01:18:51,222 --> 01:18:52,629
<i>And I'll have somebody
take care of it.</i>

1397
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:54,202
No, no, no. No more pictures.
I'm not going back there.

1398
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:55,600
I'm never going back there.
And I talked to Roscoe...

1399
01:18:55,624 --> 01:18:58,092
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>
-and he's so full of shit.

1400
01:18:58,194 --> 01:19:00,033
He's not doing anything.
And by the way,

1401
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:03,333
I think he has a deal with the
motel because there's another...

1402
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:07,367
<i>Okay. Stop, stop, stop, okay?
Let me just get this straight.</i>

1403
01:19:07,469 --> 01:19:09,502
<i>You aren't going into
the program anymore,</i>

1404
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:11,905
<i>and you aren't going
into our apartment anymore?</i>

1405
01:19:12,007 --> 01:19:14,682
-That's right.
<i>-Why?</i>

1406
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:17,785
<i>How do you expect anything
to get back to normal then?</i>

1407
01:19:18,747 --> 01:19:20,017
It won't.

1408
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:22,088
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>

1409
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,450
It won't!

1410
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,388
<i>All right. Are you...</i>

1411
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,661
<i>are you in your right mind now?
Are you done?</i>

1412
01:19:30,763 --> 01:19:32,893
Also, there's a woman missing.

1413
01:19:33,396 --> 01:19:35,500
<i>What? Who? What are you...
Who's missing?</i>

1414
01:19:35,602 --> 01:19:37,002
My patient. She's missing.

1415
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:38,949
She left and she's not picking
up her phone, and she's...

1416
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:42,137
<i>Oh, okay. Okay.
Yeah, let's take a deep breath.</i>

1417
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,070
<i>-Start from the beginning.</i>
-No, no, no.

1418
01:19:44,173 --> 01:19:45,910
I can't talk to you about this.

1419
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:47,913
<i>Why aren't you going
back into the group?</i>

1420
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:49,660
I'll just talk to
my therapist later. I... This...

1421
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,794
This is fine.
Everything's fine.

1422
01:19:50,818 --> 01:19:51,890
<i>Hey, hey.
Slow down. Slow down.</i>

1423
01:19:51,914 --> 01:19:53,215
Everything's fine.

1424
01:19:53,317 --> 01:19:54,900
<i>How many times a week
do you see that guy?</i>

1425
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:56,131
<i>I just looked in the bank
accounts. How often...</i>

1426
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:59,960
-Every day. Every day.
<i>-Every day?! Come on!</i>

1427
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,666
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
<i>-That's costing us a fortune!</i>

1428
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:06,329
No sitting idle in vehicles.
Please move the car or yourself.

1429
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:10,204
I have a right to sit in my car
without you harassing me!

1430
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:10,965
<i>- What</i>
- Yeah.

1431
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,187
<i>Are you talking to somebody?</i>

1432
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:13,607
Yeah,
there's this creepy asshole

1433
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,741
who's harassing me
every fucking day!

1434
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:17,283
He harasses me.
He's obsessed with me.

1435
01:20:17,307 --> 01:20:19,039
He's back at my window
wanting something!

1436
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,273
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1437
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:21,657
Are you going to leave
the parking lot

1438
01:20:21,681 --> 01:20:22,581
or get out of your car!

1439
01:20:22,683 --> 01:20:24,181
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

1440
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:26,584
-I will call the police!
-Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1441
01:20:26,686 --> 01:20:27,987
-Call the police.
-Move!

1442
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,395
Call the police. Yeah, I'm gonna
call the police on you!

1443
01:20:29,419 --> 01:20:30,817
I never want
to see you here again!

1444
01:20:30,919 --> 01:20:32,021
Oh, my God!

1445
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:33,828
You're harass...
This is harassment!

1446
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:05,354
Anything in particular
keeping you silent right now?

1447
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,557
The fact that I want to be
silent is keeping me silent.

1448
01:21:11,865 --> 01:21:13,934
-I think...
-This isn't about you.

1449
01:21:16,537 --> 01:21:18,804
What I mean is I...

1450
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:20,974
I mean, I pay for your time.

1451
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:25,212
Right? So I can do
anything I want with that time,

1452
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:28,014
and right now...

1453
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:33,985
I just want to lay here
without you talking.

1454
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:36,517
Well, you did not have to
come here for that.

1455
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:39,388
Go lie on your own couch.

1456
01:21:41,295 --> 01:21:44,189
Do you wish I lied on my own
couch instead of coming here?

1457
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:48,532
All I'm saying is
you chose not to be alone.

1458
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:51,664
Oh, I'm alone.

1459
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:56,002
No, you're not alone. I'm here.

1460
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:58,909
But no, you aren't. Not really.

1461
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:01,146
-What we can do...
-Can we just not?

1462
01:22:01,977 --> 01:22:03,247
Seriously.

1463
01:22:08,653 --> 01:22:09,782
Okay.

1464
01:22:10,118 --> 01:22:11,452
Do you know what?

1465
01:22:11,554 --> 01:22:15,228
Did I ever tell you
that I was pregnant before?

1466
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:17,624
Like, I've been pregnant twice.

1467
01:22:22,802 --> 01:22:24,697
I never tell anyone this.

1468
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:30,307
It was when Charles and I
were first dating and, um...

1469
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:37,715
I got an abortion
right away, like...

1470
01:22:37,817 --> 01:22:39,184
I took a pregnancy test

1471
01:22:39,286 --> 01:22:43,089
and then just went to
a random clinic the next day.

1472
01:22:45,555 --> 01:22:49,524
I got the surgical kind
with the vacuum thing.

1473
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:52,560
And it...

1474
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:55,970
hurt really badly, like...

1475
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,469
A nurse held my hand.

1476
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,175
And for some reason,

1477
01:23:05,278 --> 01:23:07,443
I didn't realize
how badly it would hurt but...

1478
01:23:09,378 --> 01:23:11,117
it really did.

1479
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:17,953
Yeah, it was almost
20 years ago.

1480
01:23:18,655 --> 01:23:21,657
I'd have a kid in college
by now if I hadn't done that.

1481
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,743
Maybe I got rid
of the wrong one.

1482
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,647
Why won't you say anything?

1483
01:23:49,084 --> 01:23:50,651
I can't breathe.

1484
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:58,395
You don't get it.
You don't see.

1485
01:24:00,563 --> 01:24:04,198
You... you love to tell me
I don't get it.

1486
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,605
What is it you think
I don't get?

1487
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:09,673
What is it you're so sure...

1488
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:11,912
I can't help you with?

1489
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,313
I'm one of those people that's
not supposed to be a mom.

1490
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,987
I'm not a mom. I'm not.

1491
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,559
This isn't supposed to be
what it's like.

1492
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:25,323
This isn't it.
This can't be it.

1493
01:24:28,092 --> 01:24:30,229
Will you say something?!

1494
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:35,366
Not everyone can do it.
I can't...

1495
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,603
Do you have any kids?

1496
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:47,081
Do you have a kid!?

1497
01:24:49,245 --> 01:24:52,152
Hello!

1498
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,817
Why won't you talk to me?!
Why won't you help me?!

1499
01:25:01,423 --> 01:25:03,526
I know what you're doing...

1500
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,100
and I can't have it.

1501
01:25:07,965 --> 01:25:09,763
What am I doing?

1502
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:14,675
This isn't working.

1503
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,211
What do you mean?

1504
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:22,743
We can't see each other anymore.

1505
01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:59,615
I got here early.

1506
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:02,618
You'll have to wait outside.

1507
01:26:14,197 --> 01:26:15,663
<i>Uh, look,</i>

1508
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:16,662
<i>I don't know why
you aren't answering your cell,</i>

1509
01:26:16,764 --> 01:26:19,001
<i>but Dr. Spring called and...</i>

1510
01:26:19,103 --> 01:26:20,637
<i>It's Dr. Spring.</i>

1511
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:22,854
<i>You cannot bring your daughter
here for further treatment</i>

1512
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:24,738
<i>until we have...</i>

1513
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,111
<i>You are too much, you know?</i>

1514
01:26:27,213 --> 01:26:28,674
<i>You are... I'm gonna...</i>

1515
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:30,178
<i>Hey, thanks for checking in.</i>

1516
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,613
<i>In case you forgot,</i>

1517
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:33,429
<i>my wife still happens
to be fucking missing.</i>

1518
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:35,213
<i>You know, I don't know
what kind of number...</i>

1519
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,954
What the fuck?

1520
01:26:47,329 --> 01:26:48,794
<i>You...</i>

1521
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:51,733
<i>You mentioned
an aphorism from the Bible</i>

1522
01:26:51,835 --> 01:26:54,434
<i>about a millstone.
Would you say what that is?</i>

1523
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:58,372
<i>That it's better to tie a stone
around your neck</i>

1524
01:26:58,474 --> 01:27:00,774
<i>and throw yourself into the sea</i>

1525
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:04,817
<i>than to cause anyone
to stumble... stumble.</i>

1526
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:06,957
<i>All right, let me
make sure I'm getting that.</i>

1527
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:08,916
<i>It's better to tie a millstone
around your neck</i>

1528
01:27:09,018 --> 01:27:12,825
<i>and throw yourself in the sea
rather than to do what?</i>

1529
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:15,790
<i>Cause someone
to stumble. Stumble.</i>

1530
01:27:15,892 --> 01:27:19,230
<i>To cause
someone to stumble? Okay.</i>

1531
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:21,464
<i>What were you trying
to accomplish there</i>

1532
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:24,103
<i>when you did take your
children's lives?</i>

1533
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:37,878
All women,
all Gen Z group think.

1534
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:40,617
Like, what are your thoughts?

1535
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,887
And?

1536
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:49,661
Hello?

1537
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:51,993
Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1538
01:27:52,095 --> 01:27:53,299
Mm-hm.

1539
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,731
That is totally
unbelievable, right?

1540
01:27:56,832 --> 01:28:00,539
That's completely unbelievable.
All of it.

1541
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:03,709
-But Dr. Spring said...
-I don't care what she said.

1542
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:04,870
I'm telling you,

1543
01:28:04,972 --> 01:28:08,675
I had a work emergency
and I couldn't stay.

1544
01:28:08,777 --> 01:28:11,450
I had to leave.
It isn't my fault.

1545
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:13,658
I came right back to pick you up
when I was supposed to

1546
01:28:13,682 --> 01:28:16,354
like I always do.
I just... I just...

1547
01:28:16,656 --> 01:28:20,126
I just couldn't stay
for the group, but, you know...

1548
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,571
I work with
a lot of very sick people,

1549
01:28:21,595 --> 01:28:24,223
-honey, and sometimes they are...
-Sicker than me?

1550
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:27,797
Sick in a different
way than you.

1551
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:30,937
-But Dr. Spring said...
-I told you,

1552
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,200
I don't care what she said.

1553
01:28:33,302 --> 01:28:34,370
I'm your mother.

1554
01:28:34,472 --> 01:28:37,641
She loves me though.
She said so.

1555
01:28:39,143 --> 01:28:40,677
She said that?

1556
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,976
She loves all of us. The kids.

1557
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:46,286
She has no right to
tell you that. She's a doctor.

1558
01:28:46,388 --> 01:28:48,586
-She doesn't have a right...
-It's true, though!

1559
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:50,850
You know, I don't think we need
the program anymore.

1560
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:53,759
-I'm better?
-Yeah. I think maybe, yeah.

1561
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:55,290
Maybe we...

1562
01:28:55,392 --> 01:28:56,990
we just do it, you and me.

1563
01:28:57,932 --> 01:28:59,564
What would happen?

1564
01:29:00,964 --> 01:29:04,800
Uh... So many
wonderful things. You would...

1565
01:29:05,867 --> 01:29:07,369
You'd be able
to get the tube out,

1566
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:08,772
and you could go back to school

1567
01:29:08,874 --> 01:29:11,339
and you'd be eating everything
delicious in the whole word.

1568
01:29:11,441 --> 01:29:13,579
Wouldn't that be great?

1569
01:29:13,914 --> 01:29:15,514
You can do that?

1570
01:29:16,377 --> 01:29:17,844
Do what?

1571
01:29:17,946 --> 01:29:21,148
Make me better?
I won't need the machine?

1572
01:29:21,484 --> 01:29:22,950
Well...

1573
01:29:23,652 --> 01:29:25,055
I'm better? They said that?

1574
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:26,693
I think, maybe.

1575
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:28,360
You know, and...

1576
01:29:28,462 --> 01:29:31,624
And if not, then
we'll just do it, you know?

1577
01:29:31,726 --> 01:29:33,133
You're better than you were,

1578
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:34,995
and Dr. Spring's
not the boss of us.

1579
01:29:41,336 --> 01:29:42,508
Mommy?

1580
01:29:44,109 --> 01:29:45,109
Yeah?

1581
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,743
I'm really
sorry, but I'm not better.

1582
01:29:48,845 --> 01:29:51,649
Please don't be mad or sad
that I said that.

1583
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,742
Hello?

1584
01:30:17,444 --> 01:30:18,607
<i>There's someone here</i>

1585
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:20,513
<i>who wants to see you
in the lobby.</i>

1586
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,683
What? Who?

1587
01:30:26,848 --> 01:30:29,888
<i>Won't say. Come down or don't.</i>

1588
01:30:38,165 --> 01:30:40,060
Thanks for checking on me.

1589
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,368
Oh, you would not believe
the day I had, honestly.

1590
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,932
After you just left me
all alone,

1591
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:48,835
abandoned in your
spooky-ass apartment,

1592
01:30:48,937 --> 01:30:50,120
with my bone sticking
out my leg.

1593
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:50,909
I called you an ambulance.

1594
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:52,179
No big deal.

1595
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:53,077
What else did you expect me
to do?

1596
01:30:53,179 --> 01:30:54,379
It's really painful.

1597
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,580
I had to get back here
to my kid, okay?

1598
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:58,683
Mother of the fucking year.
I almost forgot.

1599
01:30:59,316 --> 01:31:00,385
I don't care.

1600
01:31:00,487 --> 01:31:02,187
And what exactly
am I supposed to do

1601
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:03,419
with your brick of cocaine?

1602
01:31:03,521 --> 01:31:04,923
-Flush it.
-Okay.

1603
01:31:05,025 --> 01:31:05,918
It must be nice.

1604
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:08,022
Why didn't they give
you any crutches?

1605
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:11,531
Fuck them crutches.

1606
01:31:27,214 --> 01:31:28,911
It's... It is you!

1607
01:31:30,282 --> 01:31:32,048
You... you're here.

1608
01:31:32,317 --> 01:31:33,850
I hope that's okay.

1609
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:36,920
I accidentally followed you
this one time, and...

1610
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:38,518
You live here?

1611
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,495
Are... are you okay?

1612
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:44,865
-I'm okay.
-Okay. Okay.

1613
01:31:44,967 --> 01:31:46,530
Where did you go?

1614
01:31:46,698 --> 01:31:50,233
I just...
I... I had to get out of there.

1615
01:31:50,735 --> 01:31:53,906
-Okay, I understand. So, let's...
-Do you?

1616
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,807
Do you really,
really understand?

1617
01:31:57,473 --> 01:31:58,545
I think so.

1618
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:01,244
Oh, shit. No. This is...

1619
01:32:01,346 --> 01:32:03,008
This is a mistake.

1620
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:05,644
This is a mistake
because I thought...

1621
01:32:05,913 --> 01:32:07,749
I thought that you understood,

1622
01:32:07,851 --> 01:32:09,362
and that
I wouldn't even have to say...

1623
01:32:09,386 --> 01:32:10,754
Let's calm down.

1624
01:32:10,856 --> 01:32:11,996
I think what we should do
is get in a car right now

1625
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,519
and go straight
to the emergency room.

1626
01:32:13,621 --> 01:32:14,521
A hospital?

1627
01:32:14,623 --> 01:32:16,121
-Yes.
-Why? Why?

1628
01:32:16,223 --> 01:32:17,636
Because
it's just a safe place to go...

1629
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,793
Why? Why? No, I'm fine.

1630
01:32:18,895 --> 01:32:20,727
If you don't feel ready
to go home.

1631
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:22,536
Well, what about your daughter?

1632
01:32:23,702 --> 01:32:26,201
-My daughter?
-Where is your daughter?

1633
01:32:26,704 --> 01:32:28,604
She's upstairs. She's sleeping.

1634
01:32:28,706 --> 01:32:29,947
I don't want to go
to a hospital.

1635
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:31,053
I don't want to
go to a hospital.

1636
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:31,704
Okay.

1637
01:32:31,806 --> 01:32:33,880
I want you to help me.

1638
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:34,982
I'm trying to.

1639
01:32:35,043 --> 01:32:36,427
-I am trying to help you.
-Please help me.

1640
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:37,461
No, no, because you
don't understand.

1641
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:40,315
You don't see it.
All of their faces.

1642
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:43,217
Their little faces.
They look at us,

1643
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,457
-and there is nothing there.
-Okay, you need to calm down.

1644
01:32:46,559 --> 01:32:48,423
-No! No!
-You need to calm down.

1645
01:32:48,525 --> 01:32:49,792
No, I am fine! Okay?

1646
01:32:49,895 --> 01:32:51,608
-But I just need you...
-Let's just breathe.

1647
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:52,638
-No, but you don't know...
-Just breathe.

1648
01:32:52,662 --> 01:32:53,428
In and out, Caroline.

1649
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:54,530
Just take a breath.

1650
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,674
-Just breathe with me.
-Stop.

1651
01:32:55,698 --> 01:32:56,698
Just start with a breath.

1652
01:33:07,742 --> 01:33:09,308
Caroline, wait!

1653
01:33:17,388 --> 01:33:19,454
Stop!

1654
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:35,774
Caroline!

1655
01:33:38,108 --> 01:33:40,113
THERAPIST
<i>If this is an emergency,</i>

1656
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:42,242
<i>hang up and call 911.</i>

1657
01:33:42,344 --> 01:33:45,781
<i>Otherwise, call back
during normal business hours.</i>

1658
01:33:45,883 --> 01:33:46,883
Okay, call me back.

1659
01:33:46,915 --> 01:33:48,148
Call me back tonight, okay?

1660
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,831
Please? Please, you said
that you could help me.

1661
01:33:49,855 --> 01:33:52,321
Please. Please, just
call me back, okay?

1662
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:54,188
I need you. Bye.

1663
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:15,062
Mommy?

1664
01:36:15,364 --> 01:36:19,333
Go back to sleep.
Everything's okay.

1665
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,573
My tummy is wet.

1666
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:26,945
Sh-sh-sh. It's okay.
I made it better, okay?

1667
01:36:27,612 --> 01:36:29,409
Go back to sleep.

1668
01:37:59,605 --> 01:38:01,569
Hello?

1669
01:38:01,671 --> 01:38:02,671
Hello?

1670
01:38:07,578 --> 01:38:09,215
Hello?

1671
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:17,022
Oh!

1672
01:38:18,052 --> 01:38:19,222
Why are you here?

1673
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,895
Are you okay?

1674
01:38:22,263 --> 01:38:23,263
Where...

1675
01:38:23,325 --> 01:38:25,525
When did you get here?
Why are you here?

1676
01:38:27,896 --> 01:38:28,962
Where is she?

1677
01:38:29,064 --> 01:38:31,965
She's asleep.

1678
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:33,907
-With the babysitter?
-Yes.

1679
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:36,841
Look, I just...

1680
01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:38,972
I couldn't think.
I couldn't function.

1681
01:38:39,074 --> 01:38:40,273
I couldn't do anything.

1682
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,008
All I was doing was thinking
about you,

1683
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:43,243
and her, and the apartment

1684
01:38:43,345 --> 01:38:45,412
so I had to come back.
I was scared.

1685
01:38:45,514 --> 01:38:48,053
-I wanted to help.
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I...

1686
01:38:51,853 --> 01:38:53,952
What? You just gotta
know how to talk to these guys.

1687
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,356
That's all.

1688
01:38:55,458 --> 01:38:58,695
Did you look at it, the hole?
Did you see it?

1689
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:00,058
Did you see anything?

1690
01:39:00,561 --> 01:39:04,102
Oh, yeah. No, it, uh...
It was not fixed.

1691
01:39:04,736 --> 01:39:06,134
Now it's fixed.

1692
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:09,875
Okay. Okay, I think we should
just... Let's just go now.

1693
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,741
I just don't see
how it got so bad.

1694
01:39:11,843 --> 01:39:13,271
How did it get so bad?

1695
01:39:13,373 --> 01:39:14,975
Are you trying to blame me?

1696
01:39:15,277 --> 01:39:17,616
No, I'm not blaming you.
I just...

1697
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:18,984
I just want to get out of here.

1698
01:39:19,086 --> 01:39:21,046
-It was a huge hole.
-I want to get out of here.

1699
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:31,690
Do you love me?

1700
01:39:33,565 --> 01:39:34,565
Yeah.

1701
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:47,244
-Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

1702
01:39:47,943 --> 01:39:49,378
What's the rush?

1703
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,948
You were the one who was
in a rush to get back here.

1704
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,945
I don't want to be here anymore.

1705
01:39:54,347 --> 01:39:56,086
We are here, all right?

1706
01:39:56,189 --> 01:39:57,909
Let's relieve the babysitter.
I'm exhausted.

1707
01:39:57,988 --> 01:39:59,289
I want to get to sleep,

1708
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:01,003
and I'm excited to see her
even if she's sleeping.

1709
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:02,827
I know, but why don't
you go downstairs

1710
01:40:02,929 --> 01:40:04,202
and get us some wine
or something

1711
01:40:04,226 --> 01:40:05,492
and I can relieve the sitter

1712
01:40:05,594 --> 01:40:06,876
and then you can come
back up and then we can...

1713
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,600
What's going on?
What's going on?

1714
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:10,135
There's nothing going on.

1715
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:13,600
Open the door.

1716
01:40:16,007 --> 01:40:18,605
-Me?
-I don't have a key.

1717
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:22,345
Right, yeah. Okay.

1718
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:25,182
Oh, God. Don't tell me
you left her here

1719
01:40:25,284 --> 01:40:28,416
-without having a key. Come on.
-No, no, no. No.

1720
01:40:28,518 --> 01:40:31,519
Of course, I have a key.
What do you think I am?

1721
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:41,131
Hey. I'm her dad. I'm Charles.

1722
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:43,230
Nice to meet you.
You must be the babysitter.

1723
01:40:43,332 --> 01:40:45,497
-Babysitter?
-Yeah, James, right?

1724
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:48,770
-Jamie, right.
-Oh, thank you for...

1725
01:40:48,872 --> 01:40:50,502
Oh, hell no.

1726
01:40:50,604 --> 01:40:53,011
I'm not doing this
shit with you, yo.

1727
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:54,286
Not doing what?
What are you talking about?

1728
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:56,610
I'm not a fucking
babysitter, dude.

1729
01:40:57,914 --> 01:40:59,484
Excuse me?

1730
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:03,222
Your daughter woke up
and was crying, scared shitless.

1731
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:07,025
So I pounded on the fucking door
till she finally opened it.

1732
01:41:07,128 --> 01:41:08,799
I had to tell her
I was a friend of your wife.

1733
01:41:08,823 --> 01:41:11,690
Bro, it took me forever
to get her to go to sleep.

1734
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:14,133
And by the way,
I had to give her a Band-Aid.

1735
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:16,374
She has some shit oozing
from her stomach or something.

1736
01:41:16,398 --> 01:41:18,170
Hey. Okay, okay, hold on.
Hold on.

1737
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:20,084
-Listen, who the fuck are you...
-Watch the leg, man.

1738
01:41:20,108 --> 01:41:21,413
And what the hell
are you doing in my room?

1739
01:41:21,437 --> 01:41:23,673
-Your room?
-Yeah. This is my wife.

1740
01:41:23,775 --> 01:41:24,841
That's my child.

1741
01:41:24,943 --> 01:41:26,077
-Mommy?
-My room.

1742
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:27,609
I just fucking told you
who I was,

1743
01:41:27,711 --> 01:41:30,071
and you need to ask your wife
why I got this cast on my leg.

1744
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,348
-It's... I don't...
-Who is this guy?

1745
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:34,887
-He's the babysitter.
-He's not the babysitter!

1746
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:36,098
He just told me
he's not the babysitter.

1747
01:41:36,122 --> 01:41:37,165
I don't know
what he's talking about.

1748
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,986
-Who the fuck is he?
-She's awake.

1749
01:41:38,088 --> 01:41:39,188
Can we just go inside?

1750
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:40,566
She can hear everything
you're saying.

1751
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,631
Can you even explain to me
why her machine is off

1752
01:41:41,655 --> 01:41:42,453
and the tube
is outside of her body?

1753
01:41:42,556 --> 01:41:43,788
Daddy! Are you out there?

1754
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:45,272
-I ain't in this shit, man.
-Come see me!

1755
01:41:45,296 --> 01:41:46,830
-Let's go inside.
-Daddy! Daddy!

1756
01:41:46,932 --> 01:41:48,929
Hey. Hey. Lookit. Yes, hi.

1757
01:41:49,031 --> 01:41:50,233
Daddy's home!

1758
01:41:50,336 --> 01:41:51,644
Mom said we didn't need
the program anymore.

1759
01:41:51,668 --> 01:41:53,217
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you! You're beautiful.

1760
01:41:53,241 --> 01:41:54,581
But I didn't believe her
because Dr. Spring said I do.

1761
01:41:54,605 --> 01:41:57,709
-But look, she was right!
-What? What are you saying?

1762
01:41:57,811 --> 01:42:00,613
-Look! No tube!
-What?

1763
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:01,739
The tube is garbage now.

1764
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:03,615
I can go back to school!

1765
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:05,278
Oh, my God.

1766
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,282
-Oh, my God.
-But Daddy...

1767
01:42:07,384 --> 01:42:08,498
I still don't want to
eat food...

1768
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:09,783
What...

1769
01:42:09,885 --> 01:42:11,765
-because it's too squishy.
-What's going on?

1770
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,125
Will you take me
to the playground tomorrow?

1771
01:42:18,227 --> 01:42:19,761
What did you do?

1772
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:21,093
What did you do?!

1773
01:42:21,195 --> 01:42:22,333
