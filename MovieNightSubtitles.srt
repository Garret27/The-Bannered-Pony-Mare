1
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,460
Sebastian.

2
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:40,130
Sebastian, let's try and focus.

3
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,883
What can I possibly say?

4
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:44,635
I'm a fool.

5
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,471
- You're not a fool.
- Yes, I am.

6
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:51,683
I can't feel sorry for myself
because I'm a poor little rich boy.

7
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:54,019
It's not your fault.

8
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,688
Adolescence is a difficult time.

9
00:02:56,898 --> 00:03:00,567
And without great parenting,
things can go awry.

10
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:04,780
But you have to
rise above their mistakes.

11
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:06,615
Here.

12
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:13,997
- Autographed copy! Can I keep this?
- It's yours.

13
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:19,044
You have to stop
being so hard on yourself.

14
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,171
What's in the past is over.

15
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,339
You're right.

16
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,594
It's hard to believe
there was once a time...

17
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:30,681
...when the only thing
I could think about was sex.

18
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:33,058
- It's no way to go through life.
- I know.

19
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:35,769
I mean, take yourself, for example.

20
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:38,939
You're an attractive woman.

21
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,857
You have killer legs.

22
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:43,527
I would love to photograph them.

23
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,029
That was the old me.

24
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,448
I'm cured now.

25
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:50,534
I'm so proud of you.

26
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,619
Same time next week?

27
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,037
Didn't I tell you?

28
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,790
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,041
Why?

30
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,877
Because other people
need my help too.

31
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:03,213
You're gonna do just fine.

32
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,048
I hope so.

33
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:09,303
If you need anything at all,
don't hesitate to call my service.

34
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:11,054
I could use a hug.

35
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:21,857
Alrighty.

36
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,401
There you go.

37
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:29,906
Yes?

38
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,534
- Your daughter on one.
- Tell her to hold.

39
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,748
- This her?
- That's my Marci.

40
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,292
- She seems nice.
- She's great.

41
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,420
Straight-A student,
exceptionally rounded young woman.

42
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,007
She's attending Princeton this fall.

43
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:50,218
Now this is exactly
the type of girl I should be with.

44
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,804
She's a little out of your league.

45
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,807
- No offense.
- Oh, well.

46
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:59,519
Take good care of yourself.

47
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,272
Thank you for everything.

48
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,234
Schmuck.

49
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:16,787
- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.

50
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,538
Hi, honey.

51
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:21,291
- You kept me on hold?
- I'm sorry.

52
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,584
Is something wrong?

53
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,629
He told me he loved me.

54
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:28,048
And I believed him.

55
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:30,342
I'm so stupid.

56
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,677
Now, darling, it's all right.

57
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:36,723
Just calm down, take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.

58
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:41,103
Would you cut your
psychobabble bullshit, Mom?

59
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:44,648
There's pictures of me
on the Internet.

60
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,274
What kind of pictures?

61
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:52,656
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?
- Slut, slut, slut...

62
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,826
How could you be so stupid?!

63
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,246
He was just so charming.

64
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:02,999
And all he did was say
how I had killer legs...

65
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,002
...and how he wanted
to photograph them.

66
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:10,215
And things just got
completely out of hand.

67
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:14,302
You are a slut, you are a slut,
you are a slut...

68
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,846
Mom? Are you there?

69
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,514
Mom?

70
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,683
Mother!

71
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:27,858
Sebastian. Sebastian!

72
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:31,987
You're gonna pay for this,
you little shit! Do you hear me?

73
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,739
You sicko pervert!

74
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:36,867
What's her problem?

75
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,371
Looks like somebody's
in need of some therapy.

76
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,374
You won't get away with this.

77
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,251
Get away from me!

78
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,045
So, what's your name?

79
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:52,716
- Clorissa.
- Clorissa.

80
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:55,719
- God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

81
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:59,389
- I'm gonna take you to lunch.
- Okay.

82
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,790
Sir, there's no parking.
You can't park, sir!

83
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:39,554
I can't tell you how happy we are...

84
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:42,641
...that Cecile will be attending
Manchester with you.

85
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,019
You've always been an inspiration
to Beau and I on raising her.

86
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,482
We hope she can rise to the high
standards which you've set for her.

87
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,234
I'll do my best.

88
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,113
- What was that?
- I was thanking her.

89
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,908
Vietnamese is a beautiful language,
don't you think?

90
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,454
Kathryn's one of
the most popular girls at school.

91
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,958
Listen to whatever she has to say,
and you'll go far.

92
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,919
How do you do it?
Where do you get your strength?

93
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,797
I know this sounds corny...

94
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:17,509
...but whenever I feel
the temptation of peer pressure...

95
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:21,513
...I turn to God and he helps me
through the problem.

96
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:24,140
That's beautiful.

97
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,476
What are the boys like?

98
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:31,231
Cecile, is that all you can think of?

99
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,734
You must forgive her.

100
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:39,823
She's never been in
a coeducational atmosphere before.

101
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,992
It's perfectly understandable.

102
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:45,912
Most boys that matriculate at
Manchester are upstanding gentlemen.

103
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,916
However, there are
the occasional few bad apples.

104
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,669
Like your stepbrother, Sebastian.

105
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:56,006
He wasn't expelled for what he did
to the school nurse?

106
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,717
I hear she's recovering quite well.

107
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:03,221
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

108
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,766
You remember my daughter?

109
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,854
My, what an adorable shirt
you're wearing!

110
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:14,065
Thanks.
My father took me to Australia.

111
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,027
How are things down under?

112
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,195
- Blossoming, I hope.
- Sebastian!

113
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,534
I'm so sorry.

114
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,871
I think we'll be going now.
Thank you for your help.

115
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,540
I'll call you
and we can plan your curriculum.

116
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,250
Okay, thanks.

117
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,793
It was nice meeting you.

118
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,798
Let's go, Cecile. Now.

119
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,968
Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.

120
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,724
I didn't know it was Asshole Day
at the Valmont house.

121
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:50,894
Just taking the poor girl
under my wing.

122
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:57,442
- The parental units called.
- Lovely.

123
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:00,612
How is your gold-digging whore
of a mother enjoying Bali?

124
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,283
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

125
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:06,618
Good.

126
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,164
What's wrong with you today?
Therapy not going well?

127
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,916
It was fine.

128
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:17,212
Clorissa. "Call me!"

129
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:22,842
I'm sick of sleeping with
these insipid Manhattan debutantes.

130
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,304
Nothing shocks them anymore.

131
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,766
You can relax.
I have a mission for you.

132
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:30,934
What?

133
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:32,435
Remember Court Reynolds?

134
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,062
Son of Garret Reynolds?

135
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:37,941
You mean the Nazi who dumped you
over Fourth of July weekend?

136
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,360
I went to great lengths
to please Court.

137
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:44,197
Huge sacrifices were made
on my part to keep him happy.

138
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,741
- Sorry.
- In any event...

139
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,537
...my feelings were hurt when I learned
that Court had fallen for someone else.

140
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:51,871
You don't mean...?

141
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,791
None other than Cecile Caldwell.

142
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:58,002
So that's what this is all about.

143
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,131
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

144
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:05,885
When I get through with Cecile,
she'll be New York's premier tramp.

145
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,139
And poor Court's little princess
will be damaged goods.

146
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:12,976
Why go through Cecile?
Why not just attack Court?

147
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:16,813
If an attack is made on Court,
it could be traced back to me.

148
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:19,023
And I can't allow that to happen.

149
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:22,527
Everybody loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.

150
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:25,113
I see your point.

151
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,160
Why should I care?

152
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,705
I need you to seduce Cecile.

153
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,084
She's quite cute, you know.

154
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:42,756
Young, supple breasts.

155
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,718
A tight, firm ass.

156
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:52,098
Uncharted pooty.

157
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,229
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.

158
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:00,565
Boldly go...

159
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,528
...where no man has gone before.

160
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:08,656
I can't.

161
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,367
Why not?

162
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,704
Come on, Kathryn.
It's too easy.

163
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,332
Go get one of
your moron friends to do it.

164
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,542
I have a reputation to uphold.

165
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,378
Diddling the therapist's daughter
is a challenge?

166
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:24,214
She was overcharging.

167
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,219
This is a challenge.

168
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:34,098
I know how to alleviate
menstrual cramps.

169
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,601
Shut up and turn to page 64.

170
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,152
"Why I Plan to Wait"...

171
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,822
...by Annette Hargrove,
Kansas City, Kansas.

172
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,327
Jesus Christ! Is she for real?

173
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,746
She's daddy's little angel.

174
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:59,332
A paradigm of chastity and virtue.

175
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:02,669
Let's see.

176
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:07,549
Boring, boring, boring.
"I love my parents."

177
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:11,928
Boring, boring, boring.
"Making a mature decision."

178
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:13,847
Here.

179
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,975
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.

180
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,435
"Going out for a year.

181
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:21,938
Trevor understands."

182
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,481
Trevor's a fag.

183
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,775
Too bad for you,
she lives in Kansas.

184
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:32,156
The virgin's father has accepted
the headmaster position at our school.

185
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,119
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell their house.

186
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,957
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?

187
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,003
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.

188
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,672
She'll be my greatest victory.

189
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,425
You don't stand a chance.

190
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:52,844
Even this is out of your league.

191
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:56,764
Care to wager on that?

192
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,392
I'll think about it.

193
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:03,146
Oh, well. Duty calls.

194
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:06,274
Dr. Greenbaum and her daughter
should make for an exciting entry.

195
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,067
Gee, your journal.

196
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:09,861
Could you be more queer?

197
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,906
Could you be more desperate
to read it?

198
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,458
Oh, Sebastian?

199
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,921
Could you come here for a second?

200
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,934
About that little wager of yours?

201
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,519
Count me in.

202
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,356
What are the terms?

203
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:49,817
If I win...

204
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:55,073
...then that hot little car
of yours is mine.

205
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,200
And if I win?

206
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,370
I'll give you what
you've been obsessing about...

207
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,122
...ever since our parents got married.

208
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,377
Be more specific.

209
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,213
In English...

210
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,840
...I'll fuck your brains out.

211
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,095
What makes you think
I'd go for that bet?

212
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:20,181
That's a 1956 Jaguar roadster.

213
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:27,397
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.

214
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,191
No way.

215
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,736
You can put it anywhere.

216
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,578
You got yourself a bet, baby.

217
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,753
Happy hunting, Sebastian.

218
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,563
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs. Rosemond.

219
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:13,276
Thank you, Annette. It's been
in my family for over 100 years.

220
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:15,445
Does your family ride much?

221
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,281
My grandpa used to breed horses
on his farm.

222
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,782
Really?

223
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,117
What was that?

224
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,119
Sebastian must be home.

225
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:24,620
Pull!

226
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,835
Sebastian.

227
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,837
Fuck me!

228
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,548
- Aunt Helen!
- Sweet pea.

229
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,592
God, I've missed you!

230
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,969
I've been looking all over for you.

231
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,679
I missed you too.

232
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,433
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.

233
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:46,768
- Well, well.
- Hello.

234
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:49,312
She'll be staying with me
for a few weeks.

235
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,564
I guess that makes two of us.

236
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,692
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

237
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:59,572
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip us up
some of that iced tea of yours?

238
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:01,240
I'll tend to Annette.

239
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,617
All right.

240
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,494
You two don't get into any trouble.

241
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,370
- We won't.
- We won't.

242
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:07,789
Come on.

243
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:13,169
Quickly. Lots to see.

244
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,887
- I read your manifesto.
- You did?

245
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,349
I must say,
I found it rather appalling.

246
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:31,104
That's a first.
Most people praised me for it.

247
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:33,022
Most people are sheep.

248
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,317
Who are you to criticize
something you've never experienced?

249
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,653
I wasn't criticizing anything.

250
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:42,824
I believe people shouldn't experience
the act of love until they're in love.

251
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:47,078
People our age aren't mature enough
to experience those emotions.

252
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,496
Are you a lesbian?

253
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:51,582
No.

254
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:55,545
I didn't mean to offend you.
I just picked up on a lesbian vibe.

255
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,549
I wouldn't expect a man of your
experience to understand my beliefs.

256
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,927
What's that supposed to mean?

257
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,972
I've been very well-informed
of your reputation.

258
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,598
What have you heard?

259
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,227
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed.

260
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,814
Who told you this?

261
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,066
A friend wrote me.

262
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:18,860
That's a little tacky.

263
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,654
Why are you so surprised?
Isn't it the truth?

264
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,614
If you say so.

265
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,123
That's good.

266
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,959
Now let's try the G-major scale.

267
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,257
Once again.
And remember, the third note is sharp.

268
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:46,762
I suck! I suck!

269
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:50,433
Relax, okay?
Take a deep breath.

270
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,353
You're concentrating too much
on bowing. Just let it flow.

271
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,439
Here, let me help you.

272
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:58,608
Now close your eyes.

273
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,381
Mai-Lee, be careful!

274
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,926
We've had this discussion.

275
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,639
My apologies.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

276
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,307
Your playing was beautiful.

277
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,267
This is Ronald Clifford.

278
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:35,853
He'll be giving me
music lessons this summer.

279
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,146
Nice to meet you.

280
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,190
Likewise, I'm sure.

281
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:43,694
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.

282
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:46,322
It's based on
Dr. Martin Luther King's life.

283
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,992
Dr. King is my favorite.

284
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,665
Well, I guess our hour is up.

285
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,667
Same time tomorrow?

286
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:05,841
Bye.

287
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:13,307
Unbelievable.

288
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:15,893
- Some fag, no offense...
- None taken.

289
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:19,730
...wrote a letter to this chick
describing my lascivious tactics.

290
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,023
Any ideas who it is?

291
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:25,528
If I knew who it was, that person would
be in a momentous amount of pain.

292
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:29,865
- Where's the little girl from?
- Kansas.

293
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:33,035
Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

294
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:37,290
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?

295
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,419
He's from Kansas City.
I think he might be your rat.

296
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:45,131
It would make sense.
McConnell hates me.

297
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,259
I fingered his girlfriend
at homecoming last year.

298
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:51,804
I don't think
that bothered him so much.

299
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,515
What do you mean?

300
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:59,603
Let's just say Greg likes to tackle
the tight ends on and off the field.

301
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,440
Are you shitting me?

302
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,026
I shit you not.

303
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:08,362
He used to sneak into
my dorm room drunk every month.

304
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:09,905
We'd go at it for a while.

305
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,742
As soon as he'd come,
he'd start freaking out.

306
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,286
"What are you doing?
I'm not a fag.

307
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,331
If you tell anybody,
I'm gonna kick your ass!"

308
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,542
The only reason
I let him keep up the charade...

309
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:24,754
...is because the man's got a mouth
like a Hoover.

310
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:28,424
Shit! Too bad he's
in Kansas this summer.

311
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,468
Not anymore.

312
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:35,264
The football team started practice.
He's back in the dorm.

313
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:37,725
He already called me
for a pillow-kissing session.

314
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,643
Good for you.

315
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:45,566
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight on my behalf?

316
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:51,447
I do believe Spartacus is showing
on television tonight.

317
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:52,990
Outstanding.

318
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,785
But don't think this one's
not gonna cost you.

319
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:59,663
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.

320
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:03,959
Shall we say, the stroke of midnight?
No pun intended.

321
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:09,131
The stroke of midnight it is.

322
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,804
So then I take out my dick.
And I shove it right in her face.

323
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:17,348
And I stand there like,
"What the hell is this?

324
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:20,559
Grandma with the birthday present?
Suck it, dumb bitch!"

325
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,852
The Gregster!

326
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:23,813
Yes, the Gregster!

327
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,148
Yes.

328
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,026
- Hey.
- Gregory?

329
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:32,613
Hi, Blaine.

330
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:37,743
Rumor has it that you went on a date
with Court Reynolds.

331
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,078
I hear he's very nice.

332
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:40,996
He's all right.

333
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,666
He kept talking about
a bulimic head case...

334
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,835
...he dumped
over the Fourth of July.

335
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:49,797
- Really? "Bulimic head case."
- Yeah.

336
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,508
What a loser she must be!

337
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,385
Sorry.

338
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:59,849
Anyhow, Court's invited me to
the Hamptons for Labor Day weekend.

339
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,934
That's great!

340
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:03,561
You think so?

341
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,605
I don't know.
I guess I'm just scared.

342
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:07,982
Of what?

343
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:13,028
Boys. I've never even gone
to first base with a guy.

344
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:16,240
Haven't you ever practiced on
one of your girlfriends?

345
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,535
No. That's gross.

346
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:21,996
It's not gross.
How else do you think girls learn?

347
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,539
Okay, face me.

348
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:29,962
Now close your eyes
and wet your lips.

349
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:31,922
Are you for real?

350
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,049
You wanna learn or not?

351
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:35,551
I guess.

352
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:48,355
See? That wasn't so scary.

353
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:50,566
It was nothing.

354
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,319
Okay, let's try it again.

355
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:56,739
This time, I'm gonna stick
my tongue in your mouth.

356
00:23:56,948 --> 00:24:00,367
And when I do that, I want you
to massage my tongue with yours.

357
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,536
And that's what first base is.

358
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:05,831
Okay.

359
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:07,458
Eyes closed.

360
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:33,943
Not bad.

361
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:36,445
That was cool.

362
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:42,701
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald some time.

363
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:46,372
What are you saying?

364
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,541
Come on, Cecile.
It's obvious.

365
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,125
He's crazy about you.

366
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,797
He sends me letters, you know.
Love letters.

367
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,967
That's so romantic.
Have you responded?

368
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:01,303
- No.
- Well, don't you like him?

369
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:06,684
I do like him.
I think about him all the time.

370
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:09,853
What if my mother found out?
She would kill me.

371
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:11,564
You hid the letters, right?

372
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,068
In an antique dollhouse in my room.

373
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:19,822
Okay. I want you to bring copies
of the letters to me.

374
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:21,699
Why?

375
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:24,743
Because one thing I'm great at
is love letters.

376
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:28,455
With my help, Ronald will be eating
out of the palm of your hand.

377
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:32,501
Maybe we could even arrange a
get-together for you two at my house.

378
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,044
You'd do that for me?

379
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,880
Of course, silly.
We're friends, right?

380
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,841
Best friends.

381
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,428
Do you wanna have a sleepover?

382
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:02,448
Hello?

383
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:12,583
Excuse me.

384
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:17,713
What a pleasant surprise!

385
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,926
You aware this music is playing
in every room?

386
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:25,095
It's not, just yours.

387
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,474
I thought you'd be pleased.

388
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,777
So, what are you doing in your room?

389
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,236
Reading.

390
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:43,072
Anything interesting?

391
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,408
Yes. Actually, it's quite intriguing.

392
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,036
For you.

393
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,458
Something to start
the new school year with.

394
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,174
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it. It's lame.

395
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:03,676
No, I love it.

396
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:07,304
You just didn't have to do it.

397
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:11,225
Can you pry yourself away
and join me for a swim?

398
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,104
I know it's late, being 10:00,
but we are reasonably young.

399
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:19,274
I suppose your proposal
was only mildly insulting.

400
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:21,735
So maybe I'll consider it.

401
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:24,655
Give me a minute.

402
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,207
- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.

403
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,375
Loser.

404
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:38,043
- Blow me.
- Call me later?

405
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,420
Okay.

406
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,610
Sebastian?

407
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,834
Would you turn around
so I can put on my bathing suit?

408
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:21,044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

409
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:24,757
So embarrassing.

410
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:32,181
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.

411
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,685
We're not gonna start
this letter nonsense again?

412
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:38,854
What was my favorite part?

413
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:40,397
Right.

414
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:43,609
"Even more treacherous
than he is attractive...

415
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:47,905
...he has never uttered a single word
without some dishonorable intention.

416
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:51,867
Every woman he's successfully
pursued has regretted it.

417
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,369
Stay away from him."

418
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:58,165
Have the decency of telling me
who's badmouthing me...

419
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,335
...so I might have the opportunity
to confront them.

420
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:03,045
Not a chance.

421
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:11,386
You're right, you know.

422
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:12,888
About what?

423
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:15,224
About what you said today.

424
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,644
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

425
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,189
Look, I wasn't trying
to give you a hard time.

426
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:28,403
I mean, I look at you
with all your morals and values...

427
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:32,491
...and you seem to be happy
in your choices.

428
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:34,201
I envy you.

429
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,245
No bullshit.

430
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,080
Really?

431
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:39,748
Seriously.

432
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,418
And you've got
everything going for you.

433
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:47,464
You're smart, you're beautiful,
you're determined.

434
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,927
You're everything I'd want
in a girlfriend.

435
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:56,265
You know I'm seeing someone.

436
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,768
Oh, yes, the infamous Trevor.

437
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,689
It's funny how you haven't
mentioned him until now.

438
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:06,441
He's backpacking through Europe.

439
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:08,694
He's great.

440
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,280
I really miss him.

441
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:13,448
I care.

442
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,286
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

443
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:20,080
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

444
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:25,419
"You're smart, you're beautiful.
Determined"?

445
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:28,797
Listing my qualities
won't get you anywhere with me.

446
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,592
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.

447
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,428
You're really walking
a fine line at that.

448
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,853
Good night, sweet pea.

449
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:06,501
Baby!

450
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:08,003
"Baby"?

451
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:13,926
Right on time.

452
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,054
Shit!

453
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,183
- Give me my fucking underwear!
- All right, don't get so huffy.

454
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,939
What do we have here?

455
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:33,862
Look, this is the first time
I've ever done anything like this.

456
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:37,783
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.

457
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:40,035
Please don't tell anyone.

458
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:43,538
This could ruin my whole career, man.

459
00:31:43,873 --> 00:31:45,415
Your career?

460
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,167
What about your family?

461
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:51,004
Imagine the humiliation
your father will feel...

462
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:53,882
...when he finds out
his pride and joy's a fudge-packer.

463
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:58,178
I'll do anything.

464
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:01,515
Let's just forget
about this whole thing.

465
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:06,061
No.

466
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:07,771
Can't help you there.

467
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:12,192
After all, it's you who's
badmouthing me to Annette Hargrove.

468
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,278
I don't know what
you're talking about.

469
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:19,783
You're the only one who knows her.
The truth will save you.

470
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:23,370
I never said a word to her about you.
I promise.

471
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:27,207
Come to think of it,
he's probably telling you the truth.

472
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:30,544
He can barely write a grocery list,
let alone a letter.

473
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:32,337
What was I thinking?

474
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:37,592
All right.

475
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:39,594
I believe you.

476
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:42,597
Your secret's safe with me.

477
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,018
Actually...

478
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:49,271
...there is something
you can do for me.

479
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,983
So, what else do you know
about Sebastian?

480
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,652
He's smart as hell, you know?

481
00:32:56,654 --> 00:32:59,072
He's really dedicated
to achieving his goals.

482
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:01,992
Always gives 110 percent.

483
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,037
He's always watching my back.

484
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,206
He's got a bad rap...

485
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,043
...but it's mostly bullshit.

486
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:14,880
I don't know. I've been hearing
awful things about him.

487
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:17,758
Oh, yeah? From who?

488
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:20,510
I can't really say.
I'm sworn to secrecy.

489
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,972
How long have we known each other?

490
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,308
- Forever.
- Exactly.

491
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,019
Now, it's my job
to look out for you, right?

492
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,480
You're like a sister to me.

493
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:34,858
Besides, do I look like
some kind of gossip queen to you?

494
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:38,528
It's me. Greg. The Gregster.

495
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,781
I'm serious.

496
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:46,119
- You promise not to tell anybody?
- Annette...

497
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,997
...I swear to you on my mama's life.

498
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,168
That nosy bitch!
Are you sure?

499
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,671
Positive, man.
She said, "Mrs. Caldwell."

500
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,673
They met at orientation.

501
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:01,343
Okay, next.
Did you do everything I asked?

502
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,763
- Yeah.
- Did she buy it?

503
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:06,181
I'm pretty sure.

504
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,475
"Pretty" sure or "sure" sure?

505
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:10,018
She bought it.

506
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:16,525
She tried to outdo me with
a one-handed cartwheel...

507
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:20,237
...which is stupid,
because I told her I could do this...

508
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:22,781
...for a really long time.

509
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,200
My best friends,
Sue, Kelly and Frances...

510
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,244
You see what I mean...?

511
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,997
- You okay?
- Yeah.

512
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:33,125
You won't believe what I found out...

513
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:42,467
- Shit, it's my mom! Gotta go.
- I should go too.

514
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,469
I'll see you tomorrow?

515
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,054
Absolutely.

516
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,433
Goodbye.

517
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:53,186
Peace out.

518
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:54,980
"Peace out"?

519
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,231
Moron!

520
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:01,862
What's wrong?

521
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:03,655
Are you ready for this?

522
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:10,745
I've discovered that Mrs. Caldwell
sent the letter to Annette...

523
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:12,747
...urging her to stay away from me.

524
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,750
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.

525
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:19,588
I now plan to devote all my energies
to destroying the douche bag.

526
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,008
The plot thickens.

527
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:27,262
It appears that Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.

528
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,723
I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.

529
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:32,100
Unfortunately,
our Don Juan is moving...

530
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:34,603
...with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.

531
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:36,688
What's your plan of attack?

532
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,859
I rat Cecile out to Mommy.

533
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:44,112
Mommy goes ballistic
and ends the relationship. Boo-hoo.

534
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:47,616
But who will they turn to for help?

535
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:58,501
Cecile is planning on going away
with Court next week.

536
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:02,297
I'll need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.

537
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:04,966
I'm at your service.

538
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,010
Thank you.

539
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:13,975
That feels good.

540
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:17,604
Sis, you're so tense.

541
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:20,649
I know.

542
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:25,237
I hate it when things
don't go my way.

543
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:30,575
It makes me so horny.

544
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,328
I hate it too.

545
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:45,465
Seems like things
are looking up for you.

546
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,052
It appears so.

547
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:57,519
Any luck with your girl?

548
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,815
Moving along quite well.

549
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,030
Have you succeeded in your task?

550
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:12,033
Any day now.

551
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,710
Well, let me know when you do.

552
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:23,253
Until then...

553
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,176
...down, boy.

554
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:36,766
Come on!

555
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,406
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Sebastian.

556
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,700
- Hi.
- I didn't wake you, did I?

557
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,369
- No, not at all.
- Good.

558
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:00,248
Did I leave my glasses there?

559
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:03,335
I don't think so.

560
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:05,545
All right.

561
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,922
I guess I'll see you around.

562
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,135
Is that really why you're calling?

563
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:14,596
No.

564
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,891
I called you because
I missed talking to you.

565
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:19,768
A moment of honesty.

566
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:23,480
Don't get used to it.
I'm not liking it too much.

567
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:25,106
What are you doing tomorrow?

568
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,359
I'm going out with you.

569
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:35,241
That's ridiculous.

570
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,794
I got your message
and came as quick as I could.

571
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:49,297
- I didn't keep you from something?
- Not at all. What's wrong?

572
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:52,842
- It's Cecile.
- What about her?

573
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,303
You promise you won't say anything?

574
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:59,808
You have my word.
It isn't drugs, is it?

575
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,519
It's worse.

576
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:14,322
I think there's something going on
between Cecile and her music teacher.

577
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:17,492
Ronald? That's crazy.

578
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:20,161
I know. She's so young
and he's so...

579
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,538
Black!

580
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:24,207
Brown sugar. No sugar.

581
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:29,421
He's been sending her love letters
that she hides under her dollhouse.

582
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:31,881
I questioned whether or not
to tell you...

583
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:35,218
...but this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.

584
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,847
I hope I was right to tell you.

585
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:42,100
I'd hate to see Cecile
ruin things with Court.

586
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:44,686
I can't thank you enough.

587
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,647
You will be discreet about this?

588
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,649
Absolutely.

589
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:01,744
Who the hell do you think you are?

590
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:03,204
Excuse me?

591
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:07,917
I'm paying you to give cello lessons,
not to pervert my child.

592
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:10,211
Mrs. Caldwell, I think
you're misunderstanding.

593
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:13,631
You care to explain this?

594
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:20,054
Where did you find those?

595
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:22,765
Margarita found them while cleaning.

596
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:25,810
- Now, you go to your room.
- Mom.

597
00:40:25,978 --> 00:40:27,228
Now!

598
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:33,276
How dare you treat me
with such disrespect!

599
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:36,070
I got you off the streets.
This is how you repay me?

600
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,574
Got me off the streets?
I live at 59th and Park.

601
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,493
Whatever!

602
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,912
Never set foot in this house again!

603
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,207
And you are never
to see my daughter again.

604
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,083
Is that understood?

605
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:50,793
First of all...

606
00:40:51,587 --> 00:40:53,129
...I never touched your daughter.

607
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:55,256
And second, I would think...

608
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:58,760
...someone of your stature
could look beyond racial lines.

609
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,387
Don't give me any of
that racist crap!

610
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:03,681
My husband and I gave money
to Colin Powell.

611
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,935
I guess that puts me in my place.

612
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,105
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Caldwell.

613
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:13,441
It was a true awakening.

614
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:21,115
The black man is gone!

615
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:26,162
The black man is gone!
Yes, sir, the black man is gone!

616
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,471
I never knew she had these feelings.

617
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,473
You're a lucky guy.

618
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,642
So, what do I do?

619
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:50,270
You should tell her you love her.

620
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,604
Are you kidding me?

621
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,357
Mrs. Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.

622
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,235
She doesn't have her own phone.
I don't know her e-mail address.

623
00:41:57,403 --> 00:42:00,863
Ronald, e-mail is for geeks
and pedophiles.

624
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:02,657
Be romantic.

625
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:04,742
Write her another letter.

626
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:06,411
How will I get it to her?

627
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:09,497
- We'll make sure she gets it.
- We'll make sure she gets it.

628
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,208
Why are you doing this for me?

629
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,002
Because...

630
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,171
Because we wanna see Cecile happy.

631
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,842
And we know...

632
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:23,094
...that you'd make her happy.

633
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:26,014
You'd make any girl happy.

634
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,688
You guys mind
if I have some privacy?

635
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:37,609
Use my room.
It's right across the hall.

636
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,485
Make yourself at home.

637
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,045
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.

638
00:42:58,422 --> 00:42:59,631
What are you doing?

639
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,968
Before we do this, I want you
aware of the damage we'll cause.

640
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,014
I'm aware.

641
00:43:09,725 --> 00:43:11,768
Are you really?

642
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:15,813
We've done some pretty
fucked-up shit before, but this...

643
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,568
You do realize
we're destroying an innocent girl?

644
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,906
Court Reynolds is going down.
If you won't help...

645
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:26,741
...somebody else will.

646
00:43:27,826 --> 00:43:30,161
You amaze me.

647
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,830
Eat me, Sebastian.

648
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:35,750
It's all right for guys
to fuck everyone...

649
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:39,712
...but when I do it, I get dumped
for innocent little twits like Cecile.

650
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:43,591
God forbid I exude
confidence and enjoy sex.

651
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:47,970
Do you think I relish
acting like Mary Sunshine 24/7...

652
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,682
...so I can be considered a lady?

653
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,893
I'm the Marcia-fucking-Brady
of the Upper East Side...

654
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:56,312
...and sometimes
I wanna kill myself.

655
00:43:57,106 --> 00:43:59,732
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr. Freud.

656
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:01,526
Now, tell me...

657
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:05,321
...are you in or are you out?

658
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:08,366
Call her.

659
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,296
Hello?

660
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:24,298
Cecile, it's Kathryn.

661
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,301
Okay, stop crying.

662
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,971
Stop crying.

663
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:32,640
You know what?
Hold on for Sebastian.

664
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:43,401
Cecile, stop crying.

665
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:46,154
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

666
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:51,367
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.

667
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,580
I can't bring it to you,
since your mother despises me.

668
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:57,498
Here's what we're gonna do.

669
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,909
Finished.

670
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:43,085
This sure doesn't taste
like an iced tea.

671
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,129
It's from Long Island.

672
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,802
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.

673
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,348
You think he'll like it?

674
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:59,352
Oh, my God, he'll love it.
Are you kidding?

675
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:05,149
What are you doing?

676
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,235
Just taking your photo.

677
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:11,280
You know, you could be a model.

678
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:13,157
Really?

679
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:16,035
It's too bad you're not sexy.

680
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,581
I can be sexy.

681
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,418
All right, show me sexy.

682
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:33,427
That's very sexy.

683
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:35,304
Make yourself more comfortable.

684
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:42,103
No, no, no. Come here.

685
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:49,777
Now, that's sexy.

686
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,618
- Cecile.
- What?

687
00:46:57,953 --> 00:47:00,496
You know what would be
super-duper sexy?

688
00:47:01,456 --> 00:47:03,457
If you lost all the clothes.

689
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:09,463
I don't think so.

690
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:11,716
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

691
00:47:11,925 --> 00:47:13,676
I think I should go home now.

692
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:15,887
I'll call your mom
and have her pick you up.

693
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:18,723
My mom? You can't call my mom.

694
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:23,853
Oh, wow.
She doesn't know you're here.

695
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,273
In fact, you're probably grounded.

696
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,901
- I think I should call her anyway.
- No, please!

697
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:33,821
Please. I'll do anything!
Just don't call my mom.

698
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:37,575
All I wanna do is give you a kiss.

699
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:40,995
Just a kiss?

700
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,499
I swear.

701
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,922
What are you doing?

702
00:47:51,214 --> 00:47:53,758
You promised to let me kiss you.

703
00:47:54,217 --> 00:47:56,093
But then why...?

704
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,554
I don't wanna kiss you here.

705
00:47:59,306 --> 00:48:01,933
I wanna kiss you there.

706
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:09,941
A promise is a promise.

707
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:17,531
That tickles.

708
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:21,285
Cecile, are you up yet?

709
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:23,955
You're going to be late for the...

710
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:26,082
Cecile.

711
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:28,042
I need a hug.

712
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,920
Cecile.

713
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:32,755
Yeah?

714
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,591
Jesus Christ!
Where have you been?

715
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:39,261
- Shopping?
- Well, hurry up!

716
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:42,348
You're to be at
Mrs. Rosemond's before brunch.

717
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,350
She's important to the school.

718
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,270
And I want you to look
your best, all right? Okay, go.

719
00:48:52,192 --> 00:48:53,985
Afternoon, ladies.

720
00:48:54,236 --> 00:48:55,695
I didn't know you'd be here.

721
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:58,823
I wasn't planning on it,
but being such a lovely day...

722
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:00,658
...why waste it in the city?

723
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:02,368
Good point.

724
00:49:03,537 --> 00:49:05,246
Anyone for tennis?

725
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:16,507
Excuse me.

726
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,345
That was rude.

727
00:49:21,638 --> 00:49:23,597
She's very strange.

728
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:26,267
What am I going to do?

729
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:29,228
Is something wrong?

730
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:31,147
That was Mrs. Collins.

731
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:33,774
They need volunteers
at the retirement home.

732
00:49:34,443 --> 00:49:36,110
But I have theater tickets.

733
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,987
That's terrible.

734
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:41,657
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?

735
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:46,287
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.

736
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:49,206
Thank you.

737
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,959
So sweet of you.

738
00:49:52,294 --> 00:49:53,753
Can't help it.

739
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:58,632
Stop it.

740
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,426
Isn't he beautiful?

741
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:04,180
It's so wonderful when young people
come by to help out.

742
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:07,141
Most of our patients
don't have family nearby.

743
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:10,478
Here we are. Mr. Gottlieb?

744
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,730
We have a visitor for you.

745
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:18,402
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby. Come on.

746
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:23,616
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...?

747
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:27,328
- Yes, you already did, Mrs. Sugarman.
- I did?

748
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:29,830
Right after we played backgammon.

749
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:32,583
We played backgammon?

750
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,754
- You beat me three times.
- I did?

751
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:38,589
Then I fucked your daughter.

752
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:40,174
Excuse me?

753
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:43,677
I said, "Would you care
for some water?"

754
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:46,180
No, thank you.

755
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,644
Come in.

756
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:55,564
Hi, how's it going in here?

757
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:58,692
We played backgammon.

758
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,612
And I won three times.

759
00:51:01,822 --> 00:51:05,032
- I did! I did!
- You go on with your bad self!

760
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:06,909
Isn't it wonderful?

761
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:09,870
See, I told you she was special.

762
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:15,251
Oh, my, that was fun.

763
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:22,049
It's weird.
I actually feel good about myself.

764
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:23,717
Mrs. Sugarman's cool.

765
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:26,095
- Come on.
- What?

766
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:29,306
- Mrs. Sugarman's cool?
- She is.

767
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:33,060
- You must think I'm a real idiot.
- No, I don't.

768
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:35,938
You had a good time
with that old lady?

769
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:37,523
I did.

770
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:40,151
We played three games
of backgammon.

771
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:45,614
I was bored out of my mind.
I hate doing charity.

772
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:49,285
It's okay.
It doesn't make you a bad person.

773
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:51,912
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

774
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,455
I can't win with you.

775
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,500
It's not about winning.

776
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:04,091
You know what your problem is?
You take yourself way too seriously.

777
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:06,635
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

778
00:52:07,554 --> 00:52:08,804
You should lighten up.

779
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:10,472
I am lightened.
Can we drop this?

780
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,267
Fine.

781
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:22,776
What are you doing?

782
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,489
Stop it! It's distracting.

783
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:31,410
Cut it out!

784
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,079
Stop that.

785
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,582
- Are you smiling?
- No.

786
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,209
No?

787
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:43,047
Will you stop?

788
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:48,886
It's okay. You can laugh.
I promise I won't tell anybody.

789
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,987
Who is it?

790
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:08,781
Kathryn.

791
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:16,497
- Are you okay?
- No.

792
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:24,672
Calm down.
Tell me what's wrong.

793
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,051
Something awful happened last night.

794
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:30,636
What do you mean?

795
00:53:31,137 --> 00:53:33,389
I don't think you wanna know.

796
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:37,643
You have to tell me.

797
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:42,189
It involves your brother.

798
00:53:42,899 --> 00:53:44,733
He took advantage of me.

799
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,568
Why didn't you do something?

800
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:48,862
I don't know.

801
00:53:49,406 --> 00:53:50,948
Let me get this straight.

802
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:55,035
You came to our house last night,
and he forced intercourse on you?

803
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,371
Not exactly.

804
00:53:58,206 --> 00:54:02,167
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No.

805
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:05,129
Well, what, then?

806
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:10,718
He took down my pants
and wrote the alphabet...

807
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:13,721
...but he was writing it
with his tongue.

808
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,309
He went down on you?

809
00:54:19,477 --> 00:54:21,937
If that's what you call it.

810
00:54:22,564 --> 00:54:24,690
- Did you like it?
- No.

811
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,568
- No?
- Well...

812
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:29,987
I don't know. It was weird.

813
00:54:30,196 --> 00:54:34,700
I mean, at first, it felt icky
and then it was sort of okay.

814
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:40,039
Then I started getting really hot.

815
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:43,542
And then I started shaking and...

816
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,587
I don't know. It was weird.

817
00:54:46,796 --> 00:54:49,882
It just felt like an explosion!

818
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:52,426
But a good one.

819
00:54:53,595 --> 00:54:56,513
Cecile, you had an orgasm.

820
00:54:58,391 --> 00:54:59,475
I did?

821
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:03,479
You're becoming a woman.
I'm so proud of you.

822
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:05,481
I am?

823
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:08,400
Cecile.

824
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:14,531
Listen.

825
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:18,619
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid to stop.

826
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:23,791
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.

827
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,293
But I don't love him.

828
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:29,004
I love Ronald.

829
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:32,883
So? Don't you wanna
make Ronald happy?

830
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,719
Practice makes perfect.

831
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:40,891
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.

832
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,852
But that would make me a slut.

833
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:46,105
Wouldn't it?

834
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:49,149
Cecile, everybody does it.

835
00:55:49,484 --> 00:55:52,653
It's just that nobody talks about it.

836
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:57,157
So it's like a secret society.

837
00:55:58,201 --> 00:55:59,993
That's one way of looking at it.

838
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:03,705
Fucking idiot.

839
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,624
Cool.

840
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:11,964
Secret society, secret society.

841
00:56:20,473 --> 00:56:22,766
Am I supposed to feel this sore?

842
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:25,561
For the first time, yes.

843
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,146
It'll pass.

844
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:34,862
I like it better when I'm on top.

845
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:44,246
Cecile.

846
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:51,128
This is what I like
to call "quiet time."

847
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,048
It's when we reflect
on the things we've just done.

848
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,425
Sorry.

849
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:02,431
Something's the matter?

850
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,016
You think?

851
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:06,393
Is it me?

852
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:09,813
No, you were fine.

853
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:12,566
It's that Annette girl.

854
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:14,985
You love her, don't you?

855
00:57:16,112 --> 00:57:17,237
It's okay.

856
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,281
I don't love you either.

857
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:20,949
I love Ronald.

858
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,952
- I'm getting out of here.
- Where are you going?

859
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:26,371
I'm taking a shower.

860
00:57:27,123 --> 00:57:29,583
- Want any company?
- No.

861
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:32,878
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.

862
00:57:34,672 --> 00:57:36,340
Prude.

863
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,604
Who are you spying on?

864
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,108
- That her?
- Yeah.

865
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,611
Oh, no, she's crying.

866
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,614
Little baby's upset
by the big, bad book.

867
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:02,241
Shut up.

868
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,243
What's up your ass?

869
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:05,786
Nothing.

870
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:09,831
She's really getting to you,
isn't she?

871
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,750
If you must know, yes.

872
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:13,961
I don't know what to do.

873
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,964
I can't stand that
"holier than thou" bullshit...

874
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:19,591
...yet I'm completely
infatuated with her.

875
00:58:20,718 --> 00:58:21,718
She made me laugh.

876
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:28,016
So that's why you're losing our bet?

877
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,686
I'm not losing our bet.

878
00:58:30,895 --> 00:58:33,605
It's just taking a little longer
than I expected.

879
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:43,991
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?

880
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:50,706
Kathryn, the only thing you're
gonna be riding is me.

881
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:54,876
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

882
00:59:37,879 --> 00:59:39,630
I'm sorry about that.

883
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,173
I am too.

884
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,553
I'm not sorry.
I don't take it back.

885
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:48,513
I thought we were just
gonna be friends.

886
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:49,890
I can't handle it.

887
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:53,018
I can't keep my feelings
bottled up like you.

888
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:57,022
Can you honestly tell me
that you feel nothing for me?

889
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:01,526
Yeah, I have feelings for you.

890
01:00:01,736 --> 01:00:03,278
Then what's wrong?

891
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,907
It's not like you have a husband.
Unless you're married to Jesus.

892
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,408
That's not fair!

893
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,702
Why can't we be together?

894
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,287
You wanna know why?

895
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:14,039
Yes, I wanna know why.

896
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:19,378
I don't trust myself with you.

897
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:48,073
Come in.

898
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:57,999
Hi.

899
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:01,878
I just came to say goodbye.

900
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:04,464
Where are you going?

901
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:08,510
Back to the city. I may go to the south
of France for the end of the summer.

902
01:01:10,096 --> 01:01:11,930
I can't take your games anymore.

903
01:01:12,557 --> 01:01:13,974
What games?

904
01:01:14,225 --> 01:01:15,267
Come off it.

905
01:01:15,935 --> 01:01:18,145
You're hot one minute,
you're cold the next.

906
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,480
You make me feel inadequate.

907
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,817
If that's how you feel,
then it's best that you leave.

908
01:01:24,652 --> 01:01:26,069
Good for you.

909
01:01:27,238 --> 01:01:31,283
Sebastian, I don't want us
to part on bad terms.

910
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:35,078
Well, I'm afraid you don't have
a choice in the matter.

911
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:38,874
You're a hypocrite.
I don't associate with hypocrites.

912
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,208
How am I a hypocrite?

913
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,504
You spend all your time
preaching about "waiting for love."

914
01:01:44,756 --> 01:01:46,798
Well, here it is.
Right in front of you.

915
01:01:47,008 --> 01:01:49,301
And you're gonna
turn your back on it.

916
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:51,803
So I guess we're just fucked.

917
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:54,514
I'll move on.

918
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,476
But you will spend
the rest of your life...

919
01:01:57,685 --> 01:02:00,145
...knowing that you've turned
your back on love.

920
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:02,189
And that makes you a hypocrite.

921
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:09,863
Have a nice life.

922
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:13,700
Wait.

923
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:26,565
I'm sorry, I can't.

924
01:03:47,795 --> 01:03:49,921
Get it together, you pussy.

925
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:14,654
Morning.

926
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:18,491
So how'd it go last night?

927
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:20,327
With who?

928
01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:23,663
I know how it went with Cecile.
She won't shut up about it.

929
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:29,169
If you're asking if I nailed her,
the answer is no.

930
01:04:29,462 --> 01:04:30,837
She shot you down?

931
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:33,673
Exactly the opposite.

932
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:35,508
What went wrong?

933
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:41,348
I don't know.

934
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:46,186
She was lying on the bed...

935
01:04:46,395 --> 01:04:50,148
...ready to do it, but I was...

936
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:55,236
I just didn't feel right about it.

937
01:04:55,446 --> 01:04:58,531
You had the chance to fuck her
and you didn't?

938
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,200
God, are you a chump.

939
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:11,461
If you're heading to her room,
you won't find her.

940
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:14,673
- Where is she?
- You don't know?

941
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:17,550
She left 30 minutes ago.

942
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:20,553
Where did she go?

943
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:25,225
She apologized to your aunt
and told her...

944
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:27,769
...she was gonna stay
with some friends.

945
01:05:28,604 --> 01:05:30,397
You blew it, Sebastian.

946
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:35,360
That girl's come to her senses.
And she'll never go near you again.

947
01:05:37,738 --> 01:05:42,575
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Judy. I'll save that.

948
01:05:44,996 --> 01:05:45,996
Hello.

949
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,039
- Greg, it's Valmont.
- Hey, buddy!

950
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:49,708
- Is she with you?
- No!

951
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,085
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

952
01:05:52,253 --> 01:05:54,671
- Why don't you leave her alone?
- Where is she?

953
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,089
Okay, all right!

954
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:59,092
She's with her friend's parents,
the Michalaks.

955
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:02,012
She caught a train
into Penn Station 20 minutes ago.

956
01:06:02,221 --> 01:06:04,472
- Thank you.
- No problem.

957
01:07:10,081 --> 01:07:11,539
I'm impressed.

958
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:16,211
Well, I'm in love.

959
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:57,627
Are you okay?

960
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:50,073
Just a minute.

961
01:09:55,537 --> 01:09:56,788
Come in.

962
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:01,793
Bad time?

963
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:03,544
Kind of.

964
01:10:04,463 --> 01:10:08,216
You obviously wanted me
to witness your little adventure...

965
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:10,802
...or else you wouldn't
have invited me in.

966
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:15,139
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?

967
01:10:18,769 --> 01:10:20,478
Where could he be?

968
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,026
Hi.

969
01:10:31,073 --> 01:10:32,699
Some fucked-up shit in this house.

970
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,618
Call me.

971
01:10:40,749 --> 01:10:42,875
You don't get to have all the fun.

972
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,135
So I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.

973
01:10:56,598 --> 01:10:58,224
Some other time.

974
01:10:59,184 --> 01:11:00,727
Excuse me?

975
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:02,895
I'm not in the mood.

976
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:04,188
I wanna fuck!

977
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:06,149
And I don't.

978
01:11:08,902 --> 01:11:10,361
Good afternoon, Kathryn.

979
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:15,742
Sounds great.

980
01:11:17,328 --> 01:11:18,911
I love you too.

981
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,290
"I love you too"?

982
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:31,924
My God,
you're completely pussy-whipped.

983
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:33,926
Stop it.

984
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:36,554
What happened to us?

985
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:39,057
Nothing has changed.

986
01:11:39,266 --> 01:11:40,933
Yes, it has.

987
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:43,811
You love her.
You don't love me anymore.

988
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:47,148
Come on, Kathryn,
it's just a bet.

989
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:04,248
This is ridiculous.

990
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:09,504
What's ridiculous,
dear brother, is you.

991
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:13,674
Look at yourself.
Look what you've been reduced to.

992
01:12:13,884 --> 01:12:16,761
Have you thought about what
will happen when school starts?

993
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,263
You're dating
Miss Seventeen magazine...

994
01:12:19,473 --> 01:12:22,141
...who's also
the new headmaster's daughter.

995
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:25,520
Before you know it, you'll be giving
campus tours with her.

996
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:27,438
Wait.

997
01:12:28,023 --> 01:12:31,150
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?

998
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:36,781
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with the likes of you.

999
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:42,995
It's so disappointing to see
Annette's manifesto was a total sham.

1000
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:48,334
As student body president,
I feel it's my sworn duty to tell him.

1001
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:53,005
Put the phone down.

1002
01:12:53,465 --> 01:12:55,133
This will only take a second.

1003
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:03,683
Quite the predicament you're in.

1004
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,186
I don't care what you say.

1005
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:12,024
In fact, I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.

1006
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:16,195
That's right. I forgot.

1007
01:13:16,613 --> 01:13:18,573
You're so in love.

1008
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,701
Do you honestly believe...

1009
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:24,579
...you've done a 180
in the few days you've known her?

1010
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,873
Well, let me tell you something.

1011
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,168
People don't change overnight.

1012
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:35,214
You and I are two of a kind.
At least I have the guts to admit it.

1013
01:13:37,718 --> 01:13:40,094
You were gonna
leave school a legend.

1014
01:13:40,304 --> 01:13:42,096
Now you're gonna leave a joke.

1015
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:45,057
I'm willing to take my chances.

1016
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:47,435
Don't do it, Sebastian.

1017
01:13:48,312 --> 01:13:50,897
You'll not only ruin
your reputation...

1018
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:53,065
...you'll destroy hers.

1019
01:14:56,922 --> 01:14:59,423
- Hi.
- Hi.

1020
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:07,014
And this is my room.

1021
01:15:12,312 --> 01:15:14,397
Do you think we can be quiet?

1022
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,193
There's something I have to tell you.

1023
01:15:19,903 --> 01:15:21,112
Tell me.

1024
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:24,198
This isn't working out
for me anymore.

1025
01:15:25,284 --> 01:15:26,659
Yeah, me neither.

1026
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:32,498
What's wrong?

1027
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,209
It's not you. It's me.

1028
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:37,837
I'm completely fucked up.

1029
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:39,630
What are you saying?

1030
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:51,684
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.

1031
01:15:53,895 --> 01:15:57,023
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately, I feel nothing.

1032
01:15:57,816 --> 01:15:59,317
Why are you doing this?

1033
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:04,155
I just wanted to see
what you were like in bed.

1034
01:16:05,532 --> 01:16:06,907
I know you don't mean that.

1035
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:10,202
You know nothing.

1036
01:16:10,912 --> 01:16:12,830
You don't even know me!

1037
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:16,876
The fact of the matter is,
there is someone I love.

1038
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:19,754
You don't even compare to her.

1039
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:22,256
I don't believe you.

1040
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:25,885
I don't know how to make this
any clearer to you.

1041
01:16:26,553 --> 01:16:28,596
You mean nothing to me.

1042
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:31,057
You were just...

1043
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:34,393
You were just a conquest.

1044
01:16:35,395 --> 01:16:38,731
You're such a coward.
Look at yourself, you're shaking.

1045
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:42,401
Is that what you came to tell me?

1046
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,403
I'm sorry. I'm completely...

1047
01:16:44,613 --> 01:16:47,239
Yeah, you're completely fucked up!

1048
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:50,242
Get out.

1049
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:53,871
Get out!

1050
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,712
Don't touch me!

1051
01:17:02,964 --> 01:17:04,465
Don't touch me.

1052
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:09,428
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!
Don't!

1053
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:15,935
Just leave.

1054
01:18:04,443 --> 01:18:05,943
Jesus.

1055
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:08,612
A little melodramatic,
don't you think?

1056
01:18:08,822 --> 01:18:12,491
I thought you'd like to know what
happened between Annette and I.

1057
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,038
It's over.

1058
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,500
Really?

1059
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:23,753
You were right.

1060
01:18:25,505 --> 01:18:26,756
I can't change.

1061
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:29,508
You and I are two of a kind.

1062
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,846
I thought we should celebrate.

1063
01:18:34,514 --> 01:18:36,015
I'd love to...

1064
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,185
...but unfortunately,
I'm expecting company.

1065
01:18:41,104 --> 01:18:43,189
Who, Ronald?

1066
01:18:43,523 --> 01:18:47,359
Not that it's any of
your business, but yes.

1067
01:18:48,528 --> 01:18:49,653
From Ronald.

1068
01:18:50,947 --> 01:18:54,074
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet...

1069
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:57,703
...but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:

1070
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:00,206
"Yada, yada, yada,
you mean a lot to me.

1071
01:19:00,373 --> 01:19:04,043
Hope we can still be friends,
et cetera, et cetera."

1072
01:19:06,254 --> 01:19:10,800
I expected your bullshit,
so I took the liberty of arranging...

1073
01:19:11,009 --> 01:19:14,094
...a little get-together
between Ronald and Cecile.

1074
01:19:14,596 --> 01:19:15,805
You were right.

1075
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,558
You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.

1076
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:22,019
Well done.

1077
01:19:22,354 --> 01:19:23,687
Thank you.

1078
01:19:25,106 --> 01:19:28,734
Now where were we?

1079
01:19:30,195 --> 01:19:33,572
Oh, yes, the celebration.

1080
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:38,953
What shall we toast to?

1081
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:41,705
To my triumph.

1082
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:47,628
It's not my choice of toasts,
but it's your call.

1083
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:51,131
To your triumph over Annette.

1084
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:56,095
What's so funny?

1085
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,764
Silly rabbit.

1086
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,768
My triumph isn't over her.

1087
01:20:06,857 --> 01:20:08,566
It's over you.

1088
01:20:10,402 --> 01:20:11,402
Come again?

1089
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:14,947
You were very much in love with her.

1090
01:20:15,156 --> 01:20:17,491
And you're still in love with her.

1091
01:20:18,118 --> 01:20:20,786
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.

1092
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:25,791
You gave up on the first person
you ever loved...

1093
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,627
...because I threatened
your reputation.

1094
01:20:30,213 --> 01:20:31,922
Don't you get it?

1095
01:20:32,883 --> 01:20:35,593
You're just a toy, Sebastian.

1096
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:39,138
A little toy I like to play with.

1097
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,892
And now you've completely
blown it with her.

1098
01:20:43,935 --> 01:20:47,730
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

1099
01:20:49,858 --> 01:20:51,025
Cheers.

1100
01:20:58,366 --> 01:20:59,992
Tastes good.

1101
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:10,669
So I assume you've come here
to make some arrangements.

1102
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:14,715
But unfortunately,
I don't fuck losers.

1103
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,562
Goodbye, Sebastian.

1104
01:21:30,774 --> 01:21:32,775
It's imperative that I talk to her.

1105
01:21:32,984 --> 01:21:36,236
I don't know what to tell you.
She's not here.

1106
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:38,822
Could you please tell her I called?

1107
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:40,908
Of course I will.

1108
01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:28,372
- May I help you?
- I need to speak with Annette.

1109
01:22:28,665 --> 01:22:31,750
She's not here.
Listen, I'm entertaining guests...

1110
01:22:31,918 --> 01:22:33,585
Annette! Annette!

1111
01:22:33,753 --> 01:22:36,463
I already told you,
she is not here.

1112
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,927
- Please see that she gets this.
- I'll do that.

1113
01:22:42,429 --> 01:22:43,637
It's really important.

1114
01:22:43,847 --> 01:22:45,264
I understand. Good night.

1115
01:22:51,938 --> 01:22:53,522
I'm terribly sorry about that.

1116
01:22:53,732 --> 01:22:57,151
You never know who's
gonna show up at my door.

1117
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:17,963
Dear Annette,
I don't know what I can say...

1118
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,674
...to rectify the harm
I've caused you.

1119
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:25,637
The truth is, being with you was
the only time I've ever been happy.

1120
01:23:26,556 --> 01:23:28,849
My whole life has been a joke.

1121
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:33,353
I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery.

1122
01:23:34,064 --> 01:23:37,816
Well, it finally backfired.

1123
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:42,154
I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved.

1124
01:23:44,282 --> 01:23:47,284
Enclosed is
my most prized possession:

1125
01:23:47,452 --> 01:23:48,827
My journal.

1126
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:52,664
For a long time,
I considered it my trophy.

1127
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,834
A sordid collection
of my conquests.

1128
01:23:56,836 --> 01:23:59,880
If you want to know the truth,
then please read it.

1129
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,673
No more lies.

1130
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,898
Please give me another chance.

1131
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:20,025
I'm a wreck without you.

1132
01:24:47,762 --> 01:24:49,930
- Hello.
- Ronald?

1133
01:24:50,098 --> 01:24:53,600
- Yeah?
- It's Kathryn.

1134
01:24:53,768 --> 01:24:54,852
What's up?

1135
01:24:55,728 --> 01:24:59,314
- Is everything okay?
- No.

1136
01:24:59,816 --> 01:25:03,110
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.

1137
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:06,738
- What do you mean?
- He hit me and then he took off.

1138
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:11,368
I'm just afraid to be alone.
Please, I really need you.

1139
01:25:11,578 --> 01:25:13,787
Okay, just settle down.

1140
01:25:14,747 --> 01:25:17,749
There's more.
It involves Cecile.

1141
01:25:20,587 --> 01:25:22,796
Stay there. I'll be right over.

1142
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:43,126
Son of a bitch.

1143
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:46,838
Valmont.

1144
01:26:48,508 --> 01:26:51,551
- Hey, Ronald.
- We have some talking to do.

1145
01:26:52,762 --> 01:26:55,472
Can we do it later?
I've had a really bad night.

1146
01:26:55,723 --> 01:26:56,765
What's your problem?

1147
01:26:56,933 --> 01:26:59,351
Where do you come off,
hitting Kathryn?

1148
01:26:59,727 --> 01:27:02,354
- Christ, she got to you too.
- She told me everything.

1149
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:05,232
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1150
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:07,359
She told me you fucked Cecile.

1151
01:27:10,697 --> 01:27:12,614
It's true, isn't it?

1152
01:27:14,534 --> 01:27:16,618
- I'm sorry...
- Motherfucker!

1153
01:27:24,043 --> 01:27:25,502
Sebastian.

1154
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:29,548
Sebastian!

1155
01:27:31,759 --> 01:27:32,884
Stop it!

1156
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:44,938
- Shit!
- Annette!

1157
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:05,250
Sebastian.

1158
01:28:09,213 --> 01:28:10,964
I love you, Annette.

1159
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:13,675
I love you too.

1160
01:28:23,102 --> 01:28:24,603
Just hold on.

1161
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:40,202
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep...

1162
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:43,830
...it saddens me to start
our new school year...

1163
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,291
...with such a mournful tone.

1164
01:29:10,274 --> 01:29:12,317
I didn't know anyone else
was in here.

1165
01:29:12,485 --> 01:29:13,819
I'm sorry.

1166
01:29:14,445 --> 01:29:17,322
- I'm Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.

1167
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,366
Have we met?

1168
01:29:19,867 --> 01:29:21,618
I don't think so.

1169
01:29:22,578 --> 01:29:25,205
Your father's the new headmaster
at Manchester, right?

1170
01:29:25,415 --> 01:29:26,665
That's right.

1171
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,918
I was sorry to hear
about your brother.

1172
01:29:30,253 --> 01:29:31,670
Are you okay?

1173
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:34,005
I'll be fine.

1174
01:29:34,882 --> 01:29:36,967
Did you know Sebastian?

1175
01:29:37,844 --> 01:29:39,511
You might say that.

1176
01:29:41,264 --> 01:29:43,515
Such a tragedy, isn't it?

1177
01:29:46,018 --> 01:29:47,394
Yes, it is.

1178
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:50,230
I'll leave you alone now.

1179
01:29:54,444 --> 01:29:58,363
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I'm here if you need a friend.

1180
01:29:58,906 --> 01:30:00,323
That's great.

1181
01:30:01,909 --> 01:30:05,579
I know it sounds trite, but sometimes
when I feel I can't go on...

1182
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:08,707
...I turn to Jesus
and he helps me through it.

1183
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,421
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1184
01:30:14,589 --> 01:30:16,465
I'll see you around campus.

1185
01:30:18,509 --> 01:30:20,594
Looking forward to it.

1186
01:30:21,888 --> 01:30:23,221
Freak.

1187
01:30:28,269 --> 01:30:30,020
Here we go.

1188
01:30:33,733 --> 01:30:35,567
However dark the cloud...

1189
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:38,612
...there's always a silver lining.

1190
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:41,531
It might be hard to see...

1191
01:30:41,741 --> 01:30:45,535
...but what we should learn from this
is to be true to ourselves...

1192
01:30:45,745 --> 01:30:48,914
...and to resist
the temptations of peer pressure.

1193
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:54,669
As student body president,
I've tried to set an example in myself.

1194
01:30:55,922 --> 01:31:00,425
Unfortunately, the one person
I could not reach out to in time...

1195
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:02,761
...was my stepbrother, Sebastian.

1196
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,931
I know he's looking down
on us today and...

1197
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:15,273
I know he's looking down on us today
and he'd want me to say...

1198
01:31:18,694 --> 01:31:20,445
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn..."

1199
01:31:24,116 --> 01:31:26,284
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry."

1200
01:31:29,121 --> 01:31:32,791
What is going on?
Don't you people have any respect?
