Huh? Yeah, of course.
The engine has been hacked.

175
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:46,192
Good. Now to the next phase.

176

-Oh no. I'm telling you,
this train's ultra modern.
-Really?

177
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,629
Oh yeah. All the controls
are state of the art.

178
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,693
-It's cutting edge technology.
-Oh boy. Well, you know,

179
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,526
all this tech stuff
is very foreign to us.

And when our train
arrives on time.

182
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,391
Oh yes. I'd hope they
wouldn't be running late

183
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,399

You look a bit shaky.

I don't like traveling.
I get motion sickness.

Well, don't you worry.
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.

That's a bit of a sad song

Hmm.

204
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,897
Momo, do you think
I have a shot

205
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,965
at that ninja role in Toro City?

206
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,728
I still can't stand
on my hind legs.

207
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:20,461
You know the biz, Leo.
They audition no-names like us

We're at the bottom.

I can't wait to tell the team

220
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:47,263
I traveled with celebrities.

221
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,394
Oh, I wouldn't call
us celebrities.

-Day players.

both be huge stars.

That's where the truth
comes out. Woohoo.

For example, veggies are a lie,

that you should eat them

No, no, no, no, no.

249
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,861
The truth is that we should
only be eating sugar.

I don't know if you noticed,

cross the Devil's Bridge.

Ah, surprise ticket check.
Show me your tickets, everyone.

340
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,527
But I don't have my own ticket.

341
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,498
Ah, well that ain't
gonna have to report you.

342
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,695
-Oh, please don't.
-I'm just kidding.
Have a good trip.

343
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,632
This stray is trying to hitch
a free ride. Typical.

344
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,165
If he wanted a free ride,

345
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,965
he wouldn't be trying
to get off the train.

346
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:09,298
I'm sniffing a thief
in our midst.

347
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:13,093
Me, a thief? [laughs]
That's a good one, Rex.

348
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,427
How do you know my name?

349
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:17,027
90% of police dogs
are named Rex.

350
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,759
Hmm? You're quick,

351
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,264
<i> but I'm still taking you</i>
<i> in at the next stop.</i>

352
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,899
Oh yeah? You think some
washed up old pooch

353
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,661
in a cage is
gonna stop the Falcon?

354
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,627
Falcon. A raccoon who
names himself after a bird.

355
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,865
He's named after a bird
because he can fly.

356
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,560
I saw him flying
with my own eyes.

357
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:34,429
Oh yeah. I'm sure you
saw him flying,

358
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,392
-by the seat of his pants--
-[all grunting]

359
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,528
-This is weird. Why is
the train going so fast?
-Hmm.

360
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,494
There's been a lot of
strange coincidences.

361
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,966
Huh, Falcon?
Why are you on this train?

362
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,628
[whimpers] So you saw me
flying before, huh?

363
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,959
Wanna know how
I learned to do it?

364
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,662
Oh yes.

365
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,626
Oh, well, the truth is,
I've always been an orphan.

366
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:56,298
An orphaned raccoon isn't
anyone's dream pet.

367
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,263
No one wanted to take me in.
No one helped feed me.

368
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,595
-No one even looked at me.
-Poor thing.

369
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,232
Then one day I was looking
through some trash cans.

370
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,666
You went through the trash?
Ugh. I had a feeling.

371
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,431
Of course. What else could I do?

372
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,664
I didn't have an owner to fill
my food bowl every day.

373
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:14,196
-Yes. Well, I think it's more
a matter of will.
-Whatever.

374
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:17,361
Anyway, a human snuck up
on me and then...

375
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,227
-[snores, moans]
-...he pulled out a rifle

376
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:22,359
-and bang!
-[whimpers]

377
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,129
...he shot me.
[grunts]

378
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,659
And took out a chunk of my ear.

379
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,265
-What a performance.
-Geez Louise. He is good.

380
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,595
So there I was, weak
and unable to feed myself.

381
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:35,661
I wandered aimlessly for hours.
I was exhausted.

382
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,495
<i> But just when I thought</i>
<i> all hope was lost,</i>

383
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:41,128
<i> a falcon spotted me</i>
<i> from the sky.</i>

384
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:45,228
<i> He saved me and took me in</i>
<i> like I was one of his own.</i>

385
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,732
<i> He even taught me the</i>
<i> ancient ways of a falcon.</i>

386
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:52,333
<i> Speed, agility, dexterity.</i>

387
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:56,263
<i> Eventually I inherited his</i>
<i> powers, like supervision.</i>

388
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,762
<i> And of course</i>
<i> the power of flight.</i>

389
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:06,659
<i> And that my friends, is</i>
<i> how I became a falcon</i>

390
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,065
and got this nickname.

391
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,831
That's so great.

392
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,228
It's completely ridiculous.

393
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,898
And this, is this
also ridiculous?

394
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,132
-[all gasp]
-What is it?

395
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,429
This is the bullet
that hit me in the ear.

396
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:25,297
I've kept it with me ever
since the day I got shot

397
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:27,360
<i> to remind myself</i>
<i> that no matter what,</i>

398

399
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:31,659
[Hans]
Now, playtime's over.

400
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,033
Well, I'm glad your
guard's up, Falcon

401
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,665
'cause you're going
straight to the pound.

402
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,593
Oh no. I'm so scared.

403
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,630
[all exclaiming]

404
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,096
Where am I?

405
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,329
Uh, right. I've been kidnapped.

406
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,026
Okay, I think we may
have hit something.

407
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,929
Hmm. Must have been a flying
saucer. Definitely with aliens.

408
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:15,560
Extra terrestrials.
Extra terrestrials are
everywhere these days.

409
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,329
There's tons of videos
on it. Hey, hey.

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,963
I've arrested countless scumbags
like you and Falcon.

504
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:57,295
Sometimes ten of them a day.

505
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:59,000
Sorry, I don't remember
them all.

506
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:02,661
<i> Duh...</i> [grunts]
<i> It doesn't matter.</i>

507
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,692
<i> After today, you won't</i>
<i> forget me. Goodbye, Rex.</i>

508
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,230
[music playing]

509
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,694
We're all gonna die.

510
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:12,866
Not gonna lie.
I didn't see that in the stars.

511
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:15,397
[groans]
He doesn't remember me.

512
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:16,761
[grunts]

513
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,296
Whoa.

514
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,560
[grunts]

515
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,264
He forgot about me! [grunts]

516
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,426
How the heck do you not
remember me, Rex?

517
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:28,658
You have no idea what it's like

518
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:31,031
to spend five years
in the pound,

519
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,459
to lose your gang...
[grunting]

520
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:35,826
and to rot in the middle
of nowhere.

521
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,130
[crying]

522
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,960
Just you wait and see.
[sniffles]

523
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,494
Oh, get off.

524
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,631
[screams] Rex!

525
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,999
["Rex" echoing]

526
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:52,165
Why is this happening?
What did we do to deserve this?

527
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,561
Hey, yo, don't just stand there.
It's game time.

528
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,765
Everyone, calm down.
We'll figure this out.

529
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,231
You just gotta let me think.

530
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,458
Yeah. Well, you might
wanna get on that

531
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,533
before we crash in Toro City.

532
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:04,033
No, no, no, no.
I know the whole route
of the train by heart.

533
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,960
And we're not gonna
crash in Toro City.

534
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:07,329
[all sigh deeply]

535
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:08,731
No. We're gonna crash
way before then.

536
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,995
Right here on this bridge.

537
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:11,626
-[all gasp]
-What?

538
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,592
Oh, yeah. You see, when you
cross the Devil's Bridge,

539
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,530
there's a very
strict speed limit.

540
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:20,232
And since our train is so heavy
and going too fast,

541
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,994
we're gonna cause
big vibrations on the rails,

542
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,559
which will damage the pylons,
causing the bridge to collapse.

543
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:25,927
And then
the train will explode.

544
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:27,092
[exclaiming]

545
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,696
[all gasp]

546
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:31,595
And then we all die.
You're welcome.

547
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,527
But... But
we can't let that happen.

548
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,495
There's gotta be
something we can do.

549
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:37,265
There might be, if the train
was lighter,

550
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,632
we might be able to cross,
but we'd have to detach at least

551
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:41,259
half of the train cars.

552
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:42,659
Oh, I know what we can do.

553
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:44,363
See, we're at the back
of the train.

554
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:46,166
But if we can move up
to car number eight,

555
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,728
we could detach the cars
between first class and economy.

556
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,627
Ew. Well, we don't have to
pass through economy, do we?

557
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:54,264
Yes. It's the only way
to safely detach the cars

558
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,730
so that we can cross
the bridge without it collapsing

559
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,128
and killing us all.

560
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,594
That sounds like
a great plan.

561
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,429
Yeah. Except we're all
still locked in cages

562
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:02,999
and the key is all the way
in the next car.

563
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:07,329
[all groan]

564
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,061
But... you could go through
that trap door

565
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,696
and get the key for us.

566
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,999
[all agreeing]

567
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,596
And with all your
special Falcon abilities,

568
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:22,660
-it should be a piece of cake.
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Surely.

569
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:24,564
With all my
special Falcon abilities, I--

570
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,495
But I mean, it does sound
a little dangerous, doesn't it?

571
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:28,695
We're begging you.
Please save our babies.

572
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:31,467
-Me too. You gotta help us.
-We're counting on you.

573
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,231
-You're the only one of us who
could do this.
-Yeah. Come on.

574
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,230
Yeah. Okay. I suppose
I can give it a try.

575
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,726
Are you guys serious?
You really want

576
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:39,829
to trust this common thief
to save us all.

577
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,632
Common? Me? Ha.

578
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,299
I'll show you, grandpa.

579
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,395
[snoring]

580
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:52,292
Ah, everything
okay, Mr. Falcon?

581
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,263
Oh, yeah. Easy-peasy. Huh.

582
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:58,628
Yeah. Go on, Falcon.

583
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:02,164
At this speed, you're gonna
end up like road kill.

584
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:05,065
[grunts]

585
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:15,033
Nice going, Falcon.

586
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,965
Everyone's lives are
in your stupid hands.

587
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,727
"And this is
a golden opportunity.

588
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:21,193
Have more food than we ever
had on Christmas." Yeah.

589
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:23,864
"Come out to the coast.
We'll hang out.
Have a few laughs."

590
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,462
Only thing, you'll have to crawl

591
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,925
underneath a runaway train
at full speed.

592
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,428
[grunts]

593
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,395
Whoa.

[yelps]

597
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:44,098
Hmm?

598
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,428
[giggles]

599
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:52,593
[upbeat music]

601
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:04,131
Yes.

602
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,659
[squeaking]

603

[whimpering]

605
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,098
Whoa!

606
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:42,494
It feels like he's been
gone a long time, doesn't it?

607
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,294
Exactly. I wouldn't
put it past him

608
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:46,197
to take this opportunity
to escape.

609
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,698
Mm.

610
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,065
-[door thudding]
-Huh?

611
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:00,031
[all exclaiming]

612
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,291
-You're awesome.
-I told you. Easy-peasy.

613
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,859
Now, who wants out?

614
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,898
<i> It's all right.</i>
<i> Not bad for a thief, huh?</i>

615
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,294
I think an apology is an order.

616
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,996
Okay. Everyone gets lucky
sometime.

617
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,831
Now, get me
out of this cage.

618
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,195
I'll take things from here.

619
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:16,161
Oh, hold on there a sec, Sarge.

620
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm not sure
you're in the best position
to be barking out orders.

621
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,631
I'm in a better position than
some lowlife thug like you.

622
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,599
Hey, it was that lowlife thug
that got us out of these cages.

623
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,430
He's the only reason
that we still have
a chance of surviving.

624
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,596
-[growling]
-Sure. He bordered
this training illegally.

625
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:32,025
He is acting very suspicious
and is clearly hiding something.

626
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:34,998
-But it's because
of this criminal--
-Thank you.

627
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,695
Thank you very much.
We all get it.

628
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,831
Okay, Rex, I'll let you out.

629
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,061

We can't listen to
that psychopath.

[Hans groans] What?

647
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,864
Listen, guys, he's just
trying to get in our heads.

648
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,960
We all need to stick together.

All right, let's play.

[dramatic music]

00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,328
All right. Forget
about that weirdo.

654
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:41,461
We need to find a way to--
[yelps]

655
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:52,999
Don't worry, I'll catch you.

656

Who's paying you?

Who do you work for? Huh?

Oh, you're not gonna talk.
Huh? Where are you going?

666
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,065
Stop moving around.

Hi, Mr. Greyhound.
What's your name?

Eh... [giggles] Victor.

674
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:24,660
Well, thanks
for letting me out, Victor.
My name's Anna.

Oh, very nice
to make your acquaintance.

00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:31,398
Hey, Hurry up back there.
We gotta go.

677
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,692
[hissing]

678
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:36,094
[both] That snake
looks very familiar.

679
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:38,898
I'm sure I've seen her
on social media before.

680
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,126
Do you know about social media?

681
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:41,693
Yes, unfortunately.

682
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,625
Ah, thank you.
What was your name again?

683
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:47,399
Candy. But listen,
I didn't pick it.

684
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:48,593
We can pick.

685
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,527
Whoa.

686
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:57,297
Oh, that was something.

687
00:32:57,365 --> 00:33:00,126
Hey, Leo. Those were
some slick laterals.

688
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

689
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:05,262
[Randy]
Okay, so just to recap,

690
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,260
you're saying some psycho
hacked the train

691
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,433
with some kind of scheme
to get back at the old dog
who arrested him?

692
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:12,031
Right? What's next?
You gonna say
the Earth is round?

693
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,797
-Ah, I'm not that gullible.
-Mm.

694
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,459
All right, is everyone here?
Then, let's head to car eight.

695
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,766
Hey, who put you
in charge? Huh?

696
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:20,592
Okay, smart guy.
What's your plan?

697
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:23,299
Uh... Let's all head to
car eight.

698
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,494
Right?

699
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:28,661
Hello? Hello? Hello?

700
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:33,527
I can't believe this.
Forgotten again. Hello?

701
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:36,993
Huh?

702
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:38,527
[screaming]

703
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,130
For once I actually got lucky.

704
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,195
Looks like someone's lost
their touch.

705
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:50,328
Yeah. 'cause you
did so much...

706
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,159
-Guys, you're both great, okay?
-Seems like you're
all barking and no biting.

707
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,999
Guys, I'm okay.

708
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:55,762
Really wanna see me
bite something?

709
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:57,596
-Excuse me.
-Why don't you
kiss my tail, Rexy P...

710
00:33:57,665 --> 00:33:59,699
[Rex] You won't have a tail
when I'm through with you.

711
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:01,560
Huh. Hold on. [inhales deeply]

712
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:07,233
Water, water, water, water.
Water...

713
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,459
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Coming through. Out of the way.

714
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:12,065
Move. This is
an emergency.

715
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,665
Water. Whoa. No, no.

716
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,427
Hey. Where are you going?

717
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,296
Hey. Don't leave me
in the toilet.

718
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,462
What were you thinking?

719
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:25,626
-There's a sink right there.
-Huh? [chuckles]

720
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,131
[groans] Get me out.
This is vinegar.

721
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:35,560
Sorry, pal.
That's all I could find.

722
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,692
So humiliating.

723
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,395
Hm. [chuckling nervously]

724
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:54,395
[growls]

725
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,758
Why aren't you guys moving?

726
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:02,094
This is bad.
I really don't want
to be peking duck.

727
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:03,695
Yeah, it's too dangerous.

728
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,230
We'll have to find another way
to get off this train.

729
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:06,559
Oh, yeah? How do
we do that, officer?

730
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,331
My plan is actually
much simpler.

731
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,596
We go back to our car
and find a way to detach it.

732
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,027
It'll stop on its own and
then we'll all get off safely.

733
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:16,661
But Mr. Police Dog,
we're going too fast.

734
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:19,132
If we detach the last car,
it'll likely derail

735
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,799
and crash,
and then we're all gonna die.

736
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:23,665
Yeah. But if we
go on like this,

737
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,563
we'll all be char-broiled.

738
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:26,825
[yelps]

739
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:29,396
Listen up. Don't worry,
it's just a little fire.

740
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:31,864
If I can do it,
then you guys can do it too.

741
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:33,563
Yeah, we're following Falcon.

742
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,492
I'm not gonna let societal norms
dictate my life ever again.

743
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,795
-No, sir.
-Hello. Hello.

744
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:42,164
Hello. Aw.

745
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:47,999
Watch it.

746
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,659
[yelps] Candy!

747
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,395
It's okay. Randy. I'm spry.

748
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:01,329
[yowls]

749
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,329
Look, they made it. Let's go.

750
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:13,828
[whimpering]

751
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:15,230
Excuse me.

752
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,329
-[thuds]
-[yelps]

753
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,598
Come on, Coco. You got this.

754
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,461
[whimpering, yelps]

755
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,292
I do what I can.

756
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,929
Why don't you just fly?

757
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:38,131
Well, I dunno how to fly.

758
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:40,999
I never learned how.

759
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:43,263
[Coco screaming]

760
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:49,397
Coco?

761
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,362
[breathing heavily] I made it.

762
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,094
See that?
You were almost flying?

763
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:58,659
[Coco whimpering] Almost.

764
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:00,293
It's lucky we weren't
following you.

765
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,060
We would've been sucked out.

766
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:04,358
Are you kidding me?
If you hadn't wasted
so much time,

767
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:05,925
we'd all be safely across.

768
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:08,031
Um, maybe this isn't
the best time to be fighting,

769
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,695
the car's
about to break apart.

770
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,497
And if you're still over there,
it'll go off the rails.

771
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,529
-And then you're also--
-And we'll all die. We know.

772
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,892
Exactly.

773
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,832
Right now there's a massive hole
in the middle of the car.

774
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,095
So we need to find another way.

775
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,329
Wait, Rex, I've got an idea.

776
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:30,929
Come on.
You need to move.

777
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,259
[whimpering] All right.

778
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,793
I'll be right behind you.

779
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:36,258
Don't worry, Momo.
We'll see you in the endzone.

780
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:38,263
Come on, follow me.

781
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,127
Boy, talk about a Hail Mary.

782
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,527
[gasps] Hey, look out!

783
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,592
-What just happened?
-What just happened?

784
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,397
You just scored
a touchdown, Leo.

785
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,460
That was incredible.
All right, come on, you guys.

786
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,399
-You can do it.
-Our turn, Jimmy.

787
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:57,659
[Jimmy] Huh?

788
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,263
Be careful, Janice.

789
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:16,692
Okay, Jimmy,
let the cosmos guide you.

790
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:22,598
I can't do it. I don't think
my stars are aligned
on this one.

791
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,200
-What?
-Yeah.

792
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,061
You know how sometimes
the stars are out of alignment

793
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:27,593
and we have no choice

794
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:29,658
but to accept
our predetermined fate.

795
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,495
I know that's against
our nature,

796
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,493
but I think we have
to face reality here.

797
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,859
I'm sorry. It has
to be like this, Janice.

798
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:38,360
Just please tell my babies
how much I love them.

799
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,128
How all I wanted
to be was a dad.

800
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:42,095
You can tell them that yourself.

801
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:44,998
-But-- How did I--
-Mm.

802
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:47,464
Hey, Falcon,
toss Momo over here.

803
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,758
Okay.

804
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:51,298
[screaming]

805
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,261
Oh, it's going deep.
Just like we practiced it.

806
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:55,226
-[grunts]
-Quack, quack!

807
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,831
Go on, it's your turn.

808
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,259
Uh, would it be possible to find

809
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,166
a slightly larger walkway?

810
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:02,692
-We don't have time to waste!
-Hey, come now.

811
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:05,659
You can't just go
grabbing tails like that.

812
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,597
[whimpering]

813
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,665
Come on, Victor.

814
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,763
It's all about willpower.

815
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:15,560
[Victor whimpering]

816
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:20,532
What are you doing?
We have to keep moving.

817
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:21,998
I don't think I can.

818
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,296
-Focus on something else.
-Focus on what?

819
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,032
Look at my butt.

820
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,962
Ah. You want me
to look at your butt?

821
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,164
Yeah. Eyes on my butt.

822
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:35,166
Look at his butt.
Only his butt.

823
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:39,197
Follow his butt.
Follow his butt. Follow his...

824
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,692
[gasps, screaming]

825
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,560
Hold on, Victor.

826
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,164
If you fall, I fall.

827
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,461
See, we had your back.

828
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,230
-Thank you, Missy.
-Oh, call me Anna.

829
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:18,365
I told you, if we'd stayed in
that car, we'd all be safe now.

830
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:19,725
Well...

831
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:26,262
[Rex] Uh...

832
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:28,061
Hey, Maguy,
with two less cars,

833
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,527
we should be lighter now.

834
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,862
-Do you think we're okay?
-No. Not quite yet.

835
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,031
To get across the bridge,
we have to detach
at least half the cars.

836
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,758
Okay, Maguy,
let's do it. Come on.

837
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:42,999
[Hans] You're outta
your cage now, Rex.

838
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,528
But I'm still the one
in charge here.

839
00:40:45,597 --> 00:40:48,893
Hmm? That snake really
reminds me of someone.

840
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:50,463
Me too.

841
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:53,293
Oh, I know. It's her.

842
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:55,127
-I remember now.
-What's that?

843
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:57,263
You're Anna. Anaconda.

844
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:00,095
Oh right.
And her owner is DJ Conda.

845
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:02,329
[both] The rap game bosses.

846
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,758
[hissing]

847
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,299

00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:02,998
I just exaggerated
the story a little bit.
So can we go now?

1019
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:05,097
But we trusted you
with our lives.

1020
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:08,028
Go on, Falcon.
Tell everyone the truth.

1021
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:09,461
You owe them that much.

1022
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:12,999
Okay. I never actually got shot.

1023
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,197
I did this to myself
when I was little.

1024
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:19,265
<i> This one day,</i>
<i> I was dying of thirst</i>

1025
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:21,597
<i> and I stole a soda can</i>
<i> that had been shaken up.</i>

1026
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:24,126
<i> -And when I opened it,</i>
<i> it went...</i>
-[screams]

1027
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:28,860
<i> ...like a bullet</i>
<i> and it hit my ear</i>
<i> and it really did hurt.</i>

1028
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:32,560
<i> And it also wasn't really</i>
<i> a falcon who saved me.</i>

1029
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:35,693
It was a pigeon.

1030
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,560
Ooh. That's just what
we needed. A pigeon.

1031
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:40,227
Falcon, pigeon.
What else you hiding?

1032
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:42,026
Once a liar, always a liar.

1033
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:44,662
And you lied to us
about other things,
right, Falcon?

1034
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:47,761
-No. That's all there is.
-You forgot I'm a cop, Falcon.

1035
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,795
I realized something was up
when you destroyed the TV.

1036
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:53,430
-Hans was about to give you up.
-It's-- it's not what you think.

1037
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:56,197
My suspicions were confirmed
with the food supply.

1038
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:57,893
You were
planning on nabbing all of it.

1039
00:51:57,962 --> 00:52:00,932
-That's not true. I was--
-You helped Hans
hijack this train.

1040
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,195
-What?
-You're his accomplice.

1041
00:52:02,263 --> 00:52:04,165
You put all of our lives
at risk.

1042
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,665
But I had no idea that Hans
was a psychopath

1043
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:08,162
who wanted to kill us all.

1044
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,659
He promised me a real Christmas

1045
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:11,663
with all my friends
at the station.

1046
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:14,464
We were only supposed to hijack
the train to get the food.

1047
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,627
-That was the plan.
-So you admit
this was all your fault.

1048
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:21,028
Falcon, you helped him
hijack the train?

1049
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,394
Why would you do that?

1050
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:25,099
Because my friends and I
don't have owners

1051
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:27,031
who feed and give us shelter
on Christmas.

1052
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,032
Well, now none of us
get Christmas.

1053
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:30,964
Hey, you're the one
Hans was after.

1054
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,360
It's your fault we're all here.

1055
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,064
[Rex]<i> I was only doing my job.</i>

1056
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,230
<i> But you Falcon,</i>
<i> you betrayed us.</i>

1057
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,496
Maybe you had your reasons,
but look where they got us.

1058
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:45,498
Fine. But even if I am
responsible for this mess,

1059
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,263
I'm stuck here too, which means
we need to work together.

1060
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:52,725
Okay? That's it. Bye bye.

1061

Happy trails, Falcon.

00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:37,728
we have to keep going
and I'm really gonna need you.

Don't lose hope. Maguy and I

No, Coco, I'm staying with you.
We're in this together.

I second that.
I'd never abandoned
my teammates.

1093

In the football world,
we don't leave friends
on the field.

We fight till the end
of the last quarter.

Janis, will you still love me
in the afterlife?

1096

Huh? Of course.

She's being manipulated,
but by who?

1099
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:56,497
Ah, stop it, Randy,
your owner was just using you

1100
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,827
-to boost her
social media following.
-Really?

1101
00:55:58,896 --> 00:56:02,095
-Why would you say that?
-Because my owner was
using me too.

Please welcome,
live in the studio, Lisa,

1119
00:56:43,129 --> 00:56:46,698
whose pet cat is
on the runaway train.
Is that right, Lisa?

1120
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:48,628
Yes. Her-her name's Maguy

1121
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,500
and I-I-I adopted her
when she was just a kitten.

1122
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:55,228
And you're terrified
you're gonna watch her die.
Is that right?

1123
00:56:55,296 --> 00:56:57,831
-Yes.
-We are scared too, Lisa,

-as I'm sure our many
viewers are as well.
-Don't cry, sweetheart.

As soon as the train is clear
of the mountains,

1126
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,227
you'll go with Cynthia
in our helicopter

1127
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,099
to rescue Maguy.
Sound good?

1128
00:57:07,168 --> 00:57:10,465

But what are you doing here?

-You okay?
-No. No, I'm not okay.

1150

This whole thing is my fault.

1151
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,493
You were right.
I should have listened

1152
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,362
instead of trying
to be a falcon.

we've ever seen.

-Yeah, Cynthia. He's right.

it's a real privilege

Hey, don't give me that garbage.

Just because you haven't
played heroes yet,

don't mean that you can't.

01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,925
Honestly, guys, you
have so much potential.

1181
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:22,198
Aren't you sick and tired
of saying you're C listers,

-[both] Yes, sick of it.

1183

Don't you see the opportunity
in front of you?

1184
01:00:27,866 --> 01:00:32,197
Today, it's not an audition.
Today, my friends,
is your big break.

1185
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:35,065
So let's kick some foot.
Like all heroes do.

1186
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:37,531
-Quack, quack!
-[both] Quack, quack!

1187
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,296
[both] Yeah!

1188
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:48,032

[Maguy straining] Let me go!

-I said let me go!
-Hold on, Maguy.

1198
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:36,065
[grunts] What do you say
we go see my old friend Rex?

1199

Let me go, you big mean bully!

Ah, I never should have
listened to Hans.

1203
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:55,226
None of this would've happened.
No one would be in danger.

1204
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,225
I'm so stupid. Ah! Oh!

1205
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:01,065
-Oh!
-Oh.

1206
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,060
Hey, Maurice. Maurice, hey.
Falcon.

1207
01:02:04,128 --> 01:02:07,529
-No, Rico, you're right.
My name is Maurice.
-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

1208
01:02:07,597 --> 01:02:09,731
But come see. The train's
headed down the valley.

1209
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:11,794
-What?
What are you talking about?
-Just take a look. There!

1210
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:15,794
-You still have time
to save them.
-No, I can't save anyone.

1211
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,798
All I ever do is
mess everything up.
I'm not a falcon.

1212
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:20,626
I'm just a dumb little pigeon.

1213

[growls]

1214
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:27,098
All right, fine. Maybe you are
just a dumb little pigeon.

1215
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,661
But that dumb
little pigeon is brave.

1216
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,265
And he never hesitates
for a second to help others.

1217
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:34,029
And that's why I've always
been so proud of you.

1218
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:36,565
You... you really mean that?

1219
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:39,560
Maurice, of course
I really mean it.
And as you well know,

1220
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:42,529
a pigeon never leaves
a friend behind.

1221
01:02:42,598 --> 01:02:44,726
So what are you waiting for?
Get over there, son.

1222
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,231
Okay, but how do I
get back on the train?

1223
01:02:47,299 --> 01:02:49,328
You'll figure it out
like you always do.

1224
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:52,230
-You always find a way.
-Yeah.

1225
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:58,263

This is for not remembering me.

1252

This is because you
broke up my gang.

1253
01:04:55,828 --> 01:04:59,428
And this is for those five years
I spent at the pound.

win that easily?

So maybe I am just a poor stupid
pigeon. But you know what?

We're basically friends.

We can work something out.

there appear to be

01:10:25,365 --> 01:10:27,833
There he is. They're
on the roof. It's Falcon.

1351
01:10:27,901 --> 01:10:30,527
He's okay.
But what's he doing?

1352
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:32,499
It looks like
he's fighting a badger.

1353
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:35,231
I told you there was a bad guy
on that train. Get 'em, Falcon!

1354
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,127
And don't forget, Kraken.
Always Kraken. Kraken!

1355
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:40,197
-Suplex!
-The force!

1356
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,164
Get him, Falcon!

1357
01:10:47,233 --> 01:10:48,698
Show him what
happens when you mess

1358
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:50,027
with a pigeon-- [yelps]

1359
01:10:50,096 --> 01:10:51,826
Okay, what is this?

1360
01:10:51,895 --> 01:10:54,199
<i> -¿Qué pasa?</i>
-Rico? What's he doing there?

1361
01:10:54,268 --> 01:10:56,527
Get out of the way, Rico,
we've got a fight to watch.

1362
01:10:56,596 --> 01:10:58,626
Uh, Johnson.
You won't believe this,

1363
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:00,926
but a pigeon
is stuck to the camera.

1364
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,727
[yelps]

1365
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:05,593
[Cameraman Johnson groans]
<i>And I think he left a souvenir.</i>

1366
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,897
Whoa, Falcon's really
in deep doo-doo.

1367
01:11:07,966 --> 01:11:11,264
[clears throat] I apologize
to our viewers for this
technical error.

1368
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,929
Oh, yes. I'm learning
the railway company

1369
01:11:13,997 --> 01:11:15,359
may have found a solution

1370
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:17,630
to avoid a crash in Toro City.

1371
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:19,494
[all] Yes!

1372
01:11:19,563 --> 01:11:21,330
It appears the train
will be diverted

1373
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:24,026
to a deserted area
where it can crash safely.

1374
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:25,329
[sadly sighs]

1375
01:11:28,532 --> 01:11:31,627
<i> Stay with us.</i>
<i> A catastrophe is imminent.</i>

1376
01:11:31,695 --> 01:11:34,097
Bring us down to
the crash site quickly.

1377
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,329
Hurry up and clean
that camera lens.

1378
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:43,094
[yelps]

1379
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:44,599
[Rico yelps in panic]

1380
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,127
Come on, son. Get up!

1381
01:11:46,196 --> 01:11:47,327
I'm trying, Rico. [groans]

1382
01:11:47,396 --> 01:11:49,262
You can do it.
I believe in you.

1383
01:11:49,331 --> 01:11:50,997
You never crack
with the pressure.

1384

[Steve]<i> When it's time to fight,</i>

1385
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,629

<i> that works. The Kraken.</i>

1386
01:11:55,698 --> 01:11:57,062
Get up!

1387
01:11:57,131 --> 01:11:58,731

No, Kraken!

1393
01:12:05,766 --> 01:12:08,060

1396
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:13,963

Don't touch my dad!

1400

Force. Suplex. Kraken!

1403
01:12:35,128 --> 01:12:36,531
It's over, Hans.

1404
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,965
You've lost.

1405
01:12:38,034 --> 01:12:41,060
You're right, Falcon.
You beat me.

1406
01:12:41,129 --> 01:12:42,692
-[yelps]
-Oopsies.

[laughing menacingly]

1408
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:56,427
We're here, Cynthia.
This is the estimated
crash site.

1409
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:58,325
Yeah, but, Johnson,
if it crashes,

1410
01:12:58,393 --> 01:12:59,692
how are we gonna film

1411
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:01,062
the little girl
getting her cat back?

1412
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,659
We can worry about that later.

1413
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,166
[laughing maniacally]

1414
01:13:05,234 --> 01:13:08,392
I wouldn't count on Falcon
saving your sorry butts.

1415
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,527
You won't be
seeing him again.

1416
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:13,329
For the rest of you,
your next stop is death!

1417
01:13:13,398 --> 01:13:16,058
-Death is simply the next--
-[groans]

1418
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:17,594
Eh...

1419
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:19,926
From now on, you'll never
forget the name Hans!

[cackles]

1421

Oh, there's a switch.

1422
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:26,998
[laughs] Well, I guess
the only thing left

1423
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:29,597
to say is, good crash.
[laughs]

1424

[Jimmy] No!

1425
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,728
No one's crashing here.

Yeah.

1433
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,365
Now pull.

You saved our lives.

1442

Really? I don't know
what came over me.

Don't worry, Michael.
We've got a big head start.

1447
01:14:48,768 --> 01:14:50,064
We'll be first on the scene

1448

to the crash.

are we getting the reunion?

my whole career.

probably get outta here.

straight to the pound.

Thanks, Rex.
And thank you, Maguy.

1501

Couldn't have done
it without you.

Don't worry, Maguy.
I'll see you soon. Promise.

Oh, I'm so happy
to see you again.

1507

You haven't seen
the last of me, Rex!

1508
01:19:52,928 --> 01:19:56,132
Whatever you say...
Sorry, what's your name again?

1509
01:19:56,201 --> 01:19:58,563
Oh, come on. You gotta
be kidding me. Hans!

1510
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:01,930
My name is Hans. It's not even
a hard name to remember.

1511
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:03,761
My aunt picked it out for me.

You brat!

1513
01:20:05,032 --> 01:20:06,162
I missed out on the biggest

story of my life 'cause of you.

1515
01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:08,831
They'd have talked about this

1516
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,230
for months, maybe even years.

1517
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:11,994
If you hadn't messed
with the camera.

1518
01:20:12,063 --> 01:20:13,193
Oh, don't you worry.

1519
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,359
They'll definitely be

1520
01:20:14,428 --> 01:20:16,166

-Hey, what are you doing?

1534
01:20:37,434 --> 01:20:39,160
[Cameraman Johnson]
We're filming the
reunion, Cynthia.

<i> Uh, are you filming?</i>

1536

[Cameraman Johnson]
Oh, Johnson, this
reunion is amazing.

1538
01:20:45,566 --> 01:20:47,897
[Pilot Johnson] Johnson,
you're one heck of a cameraman.

1539
01:20:47,966 --> 01:20:49,659

Candy, where should we go?

1542
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:57,598
We can't just go back
to our owners.

1543
01:20:57,667 --> 01:21:00,032
Yeah, you're right.

1544
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:02,697
-Oh, hey, wait, I have an idea.
-Hm?

Well now, looks like I found
two new teammates.

1552
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:22,295
Oh! [chuckles]

1553
01:21:22,364 --> 01:21:23,927

real soon.

in the end, did we?

[yelps]

1558
01:21:43,562 --> 01:21:45,529
Uh, well, it'll be
a long walk back.

1559
01:21:45,598 --> 01:21:48,063
Yeah, and no Christmas feast
this year, I guess.

1560
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:49,666
Oh, I'm sure you'll find a way.

1561
01:21:49,735 --> 01:21:51,758
You always end up finding a way.

1562
01:21:52,694 --> 01:21:54,530
Actually, I hadn't
mentioned it yet,

1563
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:57,563
but I may have a lead on a
job at the Bay City Airport.

1564
01:21:57,631 --> 01:22:01,097
Huh? What? You're joking, right?
You wanna rob airports now?

1565
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,762
[laughs] Well,
you're on your own.

1566
