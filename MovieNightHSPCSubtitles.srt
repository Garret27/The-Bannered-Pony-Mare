00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,875
is our most reliable source.

179
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,012
[Chief Bogo] Bunny,
orange dog, in here now.

180
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,646
[grumbles]

181
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,215
[Judy] Sir, today may not
have been ideal,

182
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,149
but the anteater was captured.

183
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,617
By the Zebros!

184
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,185
-Zebros!
-Shut it!

185
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,021
[both whisper] Zebros.

186
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,088
It was us.

187
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,790
But more importantly,

188
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,292
I believe we may have made
a significant discovery.

189
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,662
The stolen van contained a
smuggled crate from overseas,

190
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:49,964
pamphlets for the Zootennial,

191
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,899
and some type of reptile skin.

192
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,634
I've already sent samples
for testing.

193
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,170
-And if you...
-What needs testing is you!

194
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,706
You two tore up half the city.

195
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,208
Because of you,
we had to call in Jumbo Unit

196
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,277
to remove a dik-dik
from a tuba!

197
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,879
<i>You're almost out.</i>
<i>You're gonna be...</i>

198
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,981
<i>No! Please, no!</i>

199
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,749
<i>Who's catching him?</i>

200
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,317
Sorry, could you show me
that clip again?

201
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,253
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

202
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,290
Did you or did you not disobey
a direct order to stand down?

203
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,958
Sir, we were in pursuit.

204
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,827
And article 6,
paragraph B states,

205
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,128
"If the lead officers
think that..."

206
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,930
You are not lead officers!

207
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,231
You're one-hit wonders

208
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,833
who should go back
to meter maiding

209
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,768
and slinging pawpsicles!

210
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,337
If I may, I think
someone's just jealous

211
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,139
that we got to drive
the squeal mobile.

212
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,842
Or maybe you thought
it was your momma.

213
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,912
-[squealing, growling]
-Enough! Everybody out.

214
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,847
[grunting]

215
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,783
[sighs]

216
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,685
Officer Hopps,

217
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,622
despite my best efforts
to avoid it, I like you.

218
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:53,994
But this need to overdo it

219
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,598
made both of you
a headline today.

220
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,102
And it reflects badly on me,
on the department,

221
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,837
and frankly

222
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,041
on any bunny hoping
to follow in your footsteps.

223
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,846
Not every case
is going to save the world.

224
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,615
Knock-knock.

225
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,250
Hi.

226
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,718
You know, this kinda...
this sounds a lot

227
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,720
like a... just a
"you guys" conversation.

228
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,689
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go ahead and...

229
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,725
Is there a reason why you
don't take anything seriously?

230
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,060
Jokes are
a classic defense mechanism

231
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,394
for someone with
a traumatic childhood.

232
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,697
Would you like
a traumatic adulthood?

233
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,632
I would not.

234
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,067
I allowed you to work together

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,036
because you did this city
a great service.

236
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,106
But today,
you messed it all up.

237
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,175
And now, some are questioning

238
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,110
whether you should've been
partners in the first place.

239
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,678
-Sir...
-So,

240
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,947
instead of chasing
imaginary reptiles,

241
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,649
I am pulling you
from the field...

242
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:49,950
What?

243
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,318
...and giving you
a new assignment

244
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,922
reserved for special teams
like yourselves.

245
00:10:55,055 --> 00:11:00,394
Fail at this, and I will have
no choice but to split you up.

246
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,197
There will be no more
Hopps and Wilde.

247
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,334
But if you're as good
as you think you are,

248
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,271
this is your moment to shine.

249
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,943
Welcome to Partners in Crisis,

250
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,280
a workshop for duos heading
for disaster. [chuckles]

251
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,216
I'm your therapy animal,
Dr. Fuzzby.

252
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,118
And you are here

253
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,121
because mismatched pairings
often need a little more work

254
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,123
to make them work.

255
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,692
Greg, we talked about that.

256
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,927
What are we making Marlon?

257
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,296
Uncomfortable. Yes.

258
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,064
[screams]

259
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,399
[Dr. Fuzzby] And, Francine,
Clark may be a mouse,

260
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,868
but he is your partner first.

261
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,005
And we have two
new "apart-ners."

262
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,174
Can you tell us
about your journey

263
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,343
to dysfunction junction?
[chuckles]

264
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:53,714
Well, we've been official
partners for one week.

265
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,416
Happy anniversary.

266
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,118
And we're not dysfunctional
at all, actually.

267
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,321
Functioning fine.
Better than fine.

268
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,323
And we did sort of
save the city,

269
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,160
so us being here kinda seems
like a huge misunderstanding.

270
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,796
Notice how she answered first,

271
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,264
did not allow her partner
to speak,

272
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,066
seems to be
in a state of denial

273
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,968
and taps her foot when
she's suppressing discomfort.

274
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,369
[chuckles]

275
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,071
And observe the source
of her discomfort

276
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,073
represented by
the disconnected affectation

277
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,141
of her emotionally
insecure partner.

278
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,177
Oh!

279
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,079
But with hard work, they'll be
on the same page by year two.

280
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,947
-Huh?
-Oh.

281
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,216
But for now, let's begin
by greeting our teammate.

282
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,851
Who would like to go first?

283
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,119
Thank you, Joel.

284
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,256
-[grunts, gasping]
-[snarling]

285
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,358
Okay, unfortunately,
Karen has chosen

286
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,828
to see Joel's smile
as a sign of aggression.

287
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,497
Hackles down, Karen.
Karen, hackles down.

288
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,866
Joel, the safe word
is "coconut."

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,034
[Joel] Coconut!

290
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,305
Okay, we have to set another
meeting with the Chief.

291
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,140
Promise we'll be better.

292
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,408
-[gasps]
-[Zebros chuckle]

293
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,143
[whispering] Zebros!

294
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,879
[chuckles] You talk back less.
Maybe not at all.

295
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,349
Yeah. Or we go with my
playbook, and we just lay low.

296
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,351
[Judy scoffs]
We cannot prove ourselves

297
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,819
if we are stuck in that room.

298
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,154
And if we complain
to Chief Beef,

299
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,523
he'll just make us
stay longer.

300
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,357
Play it smart.
Stay off the radar.

301
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,293
And don't let it get to you.
Okay?

302
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,495
'Cause we are the dream team.

303
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,130
[gasps]

304
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,499
Sorry, Paul.

305
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,368
[growling, yelling]

306
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,572
Roll out the red carpet.
Here's the super cops.

307
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,974
-[heckling, shouting]
-Hey, what does the fox say?

308
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,042
You suck! [laughing]

309
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,276
Easy, partner.

310
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,844
Let me ask you something.

311
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,279
Do you think
we're a good team?

312
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,847
Of course.

313
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,182
I just...

314
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,884
I just wish I knew
what we had to do

315
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,787
to prove it to everyone else.

316
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,889
Or maybe we don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

317
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,190
[knocking]

318
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,192
-[laughing continues]
-[Judy] Hmm.

319
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,529
-We do. Forever.
-Oof!

320
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:49,330
And the sooner
everyone sees

321
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,131
a fox and a bunny can be
great partners, the better.

322
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,033
Enjoy it. I got two.

323
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,868
I'd rather chew off
my own arm.

324
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,870
Happy anniversary!

325
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,176
[♪ upbeat music playing]

326

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,876
<i>and considered</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

698
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,145
Chief Bogo...

699
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,013
is dead.

700
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,982
[crowd gasps]

701
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,084
Those are words I'm glad
I don't have to say.

702
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:18,052
[crowd exhales deeply]

703
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,486
I might have to soon.

704
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,255
The doctors
are a little weirded out, but

705
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:26,060
what has happened tonight
was more than horseplay.

706
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:30,431
[Milton] Hmm.

707
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,333
Uh, we, uh...

708
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,868
We're gonna take
that snake down.

709
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:38,005
And the fox and that rabbit!

710
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:42,443
Do you know how many mayors
they've already destroyed?

711
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:49,016
One, two... I got up to two.

712
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,318
Would you like to be "three"?

713
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,589
I want them gone.

714
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,892
But aren't there... laws?

715
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:04,064
I will say this once, Brian.

716
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:09,203
You will retrieve the journal
and bury them.

717
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,606
Or maybe

718
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,907
-I chose the wrong mayor.
-[Winddancer gulps]

719
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,546
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

720
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,314
[gulps]

721
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:25,886
[sirens wailing]

722
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,099
-[phone ringing]
-[Judy straining]

723
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,243
Hmm.

724
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,514
[phone chimes]

725
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,057
[sighs]

726
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,164
Hey.

727
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:12,199
The phone is the first thing
they'll track.

728
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,067
[Judy gasps]

729
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:19,139
Sorry. I have never been on
the run from the law before.

730
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,208
Yeah. Boy.

731
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,178
It's almost like we shouldn't
have gone to that gala, huh?

732
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,046
Okie doke.
We already did it your way.

733
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,315
With Mr. Big, we do it mine.

734
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,051
This is where having
a partner from the underworld

735
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,486
is really gonna pay off.

736
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,723
Raymond! And is that Kev...

737
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,996
[♪ jazz music playing]

738
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:02,115
Welcome to my warehouse.

739
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,551
Oh, my God, I love your dress.

740
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,620
Oh! Thank you.

741
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,187
[grunts] Fru Fru and I

742
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,457
are now equal partners
in the family business.

743
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:14,596
She brings wonderful ideas
for crime and for fashion

744
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:19,199
while I get more time to focus
on what matters most:

745
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,102
being grandpapa
to my little Judith.

746
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:23,705
Kiss my ring.

747
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,272
[chuckles]

748
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,440
Kiss the stinkin' ring
right now!

749
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:27,174
You kiss it right now!
Kiss it!

750
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,009
Mwah.

751
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,578
<i>Nonno,</i> you said we were gonna

752
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:33,180
make cement shoes
for Mr. Weaselton.

753
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,148
Oh, that's my girl.

754
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,017
They grow up so fast.

755
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,186
-You shut your mouth, fox!
-You run your mouth too much!

756
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,089
Anyways, you're in trouble.

757
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,660
And we like one of yas,
so we're here to help.

758
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:48,295
New clothes. New identities.

759
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,297
Truck out of town
leaves in an hour.

760
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,567
And your meter maid cart
is taken care of.

761
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,136
[inhales]

762
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,805
I think you misunderstand.

763
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,173
We've been framed
by the lynxes.

764
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,375
And an innocent snake needs...

765
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,645
Judy, the lynxes
are killers...

766
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,814
[grunts]
...and they have no honor.

767
00:34:07,147 --> 00:34:09,182
And this Tundratown expansion

768
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,485
only makes them
more dangerous.

769
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,757
Territorial animals will do
anything for more land.

770
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,592
So, if whatever
you're tangled up in

771
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,161
threatens their plans,
you're dead.

772
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:24,498
You don't fight the cats.
You leave.

773
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,635
Sir, I know you're trying
to look out for us.

774
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,437
But we took an oath
to protect this city.

775
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:32,272
And justice doesn't run.

776
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,741
On behalf of myself,

777
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:38,111
"Rick Wilde,"
and "Miss Trudy Cabbagepatch,"

778
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,314
we thank you for your truck
to salvation and-- Ow!

779
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,448
We cannot accept your offer.

780
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,250
We are helping that snake.

781
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,819
Boy, you're really
tossing that "we" around.

782
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,320
Snakes may have been framed

783
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:47,589
for the fanging
of that tortoise.

784
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,389
Do you have any idea why?

785
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:51,759
Or how this book
could prove it?

786
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,795
I wish I did.

787
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,229
But if it has to do
with snakes,

788
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:59,399
your best bet
is talking to a reptile.

789
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,603
Do you know any?

790
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,771
Almost no one does.

791
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:08,108
They keep to themselves,
hide out in Marsh Market.

792
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,844
But you can still find 'em.

793
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,446
You just need
a reptile expert.

794
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,882
Someone local
who knows where to go.

795
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,884
Lucky for you, I met someone.

796
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,386
She runs a podcast!

797
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,089
[Nick] No, no.
Trudy Cabbagepatch,

798
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,323
Rick Wilde says no.

799
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,226
[Nibbles] Oh, yeah!

800
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,363
If Hopps and Wilde
are on the lam,

801
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,265
subtle sleuthin' 'tis my jam.

802
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,234
Woo! Mind the splinters.

803
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,737
Oh, you called
the right beaver.

804
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,840
If you wanna talk to
a reptile, I am your gal.

805
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,675
Also, if you need to talk
to a jackalope,

806
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:43,578
which are real, Mom!

807
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:46,179
[chuckles]
Excuse us. Team meeting.

808
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,649
Vetoing the beave.

809
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:50,283
New vote: All in favor
of "Truck to Being Alive

810
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,920
and Laying Low Till This
Blows Over-ville"? I mean...

811
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,922
Hopps and Wilde
do not bail on a case.

812
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,691
But she's crazy.

813
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,793
Probably lead poisoning
from eating too many pencils.

814
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:02,797
Do you know a reptile who can

815
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,331
tell us the hidden secret
in here,

816
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:05,767
or why the lynxes
framed the snakes?

817
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,635
[sighs]

818
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,704
Twenty-four hours.
Sunrise tomorrow.

819
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,739
If we strike out,
then we go into hiding,

820
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,306
and "Judy Cabbagepatch" it is.

821
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,307
[horn honks]

822
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,710
[groans]

823
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,512
It's "Trudy" Cabbagepatch,

824
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:18,913
and the safe word
is "coconut."

825
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,415
In the darkness
of a dank underpass,

826
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,950
they stepped into the vehicle,

827
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:26,453
not realizing their lives
were about to change.

828
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,656
Because we're gonna
meet a reptile?

829
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,792
Because you're about to be
best buds

830
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,761
with Nibbles Maplestick!

831
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:37,497
Takes two to tango, but
a threesome to be somethin'.

832
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:41,201
Let's find you a reptile
and romp the swamp.

833
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:49,409
[inhales]

834
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,278
Breathe it in!

835
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:52,780
-[Judy] Oh!
-[Nibbles whoops]

836
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,919
[Nibbles] Now, if any reptile
would know

837
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,320
the secret of that book
and why the snake wants it...

838
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,289
-Hey, Johnny!
-[Johnny] Oh, no!

839
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,692
...it's my old lizard friend,
Jesús.

840
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:07,929
[Judy] Why would a lizard
hide here?

841
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,599
Well, when Zootopia
was founded,

842
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,601
the whole neighborhood
got cut off

843
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:14,902
from the rest of the town.

844
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,470
Kinda on our own here.

845
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:18,005
[grunting]

846
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:19,607
Yeah, that's probably why
reptiles like it.

847
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,408
They can just do their thing.

848
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,010
Plus, it's the only place
in town

849
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,813
you can get away with
wearing a shirt and no pants.

850
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,882
Loving tour time
with Woodchuckles.

851
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,483
-[whispers] Great call.
-[Judy growls]

852
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:30,985
-We need her.
-Oh, yeah.

853
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,252
Like a hole in the head.

854
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:33,253
[dolphin squawks]

855
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,489
Bad timing. Hmm.

856
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:37,725
Okay, to get to
Jesús's hideout,

857
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,392
we gotta take a ferry.

858
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:41,294
Just let me handle the locals.

859
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,598
Water folk tend to be a little
standoffish around landies.

860
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, I've been hustling
the streets since I was 12.

861
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,435
I think I can handle
a juggling seal.

862
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,437
-[roars]
-Oh! [chuckles]

863
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:52,372
Sea lion.

864
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:53,708
He's not from around here.

865
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,408
-But coin's a coin.
-[growling]

866
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:58,813
Oh, no. Change... [grunts]
...is a choking hazard.

867
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,616
-Well, honest mistake.
-[roars]

868
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,618
Do not do that!

869
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,318
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

870
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,788
[Nibbles] Thank you, Judith.

871
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,489
Conversing with these
beautiful sea creatures

872
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,491
is like talking to anyone

But under all that snow,
how are we gonna find it?

1403
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:27,461
Wait.

1404
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:29,129
Clock tower.

1405
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,298
Her neighborhood,
the reptile neighborhood,

1406
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:32,499
had a clock tower.

1407
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:34,334
It lights up like a beacon.

1408
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:37,705
If it wasn't fully buried,
maybe we could see it.

1409
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:39,473
Follow it to her home.

1410
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:41,442
Except my great-grandfather
turned off the power.

1411
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,110
But we have the plans

1412
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:45,012
that show us
how to turn it back on.

1413
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:47,047
Oh! Ooh! Hmm.

1414
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,450
The power switch
to her whole neighborhood

1415
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:52,286
was in the original
control room.

1416
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:54,988
All right! And where is that?

1417
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:56,624
Inside the oldest wall
of the city.

1418
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,193
The Desert Tundratown
weather wall.

1419
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:02,296
We get inside,
turn on that switch,

1420
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,731
light the clock tower,

1421
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:07,968
-we find her house.
-We find her patent.

1422
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,171
And my family
is finally coming home.

1423
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:13,373
We will succeed, Judy Hopps.

1424
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:16,443
We shall succeed!

1425
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,113
[Kitty gasps] I found him.

1426
01:06:21,783 --> 01:06:23,283

Ooh! It's Nicholas Wilde.
Big-time cop, huh?

1430
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,661
I'll see you
at the lunch table.

1431
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:36,363
I'm gonna tie your tail
in a knot.

1432

What are you looking at,
butthead?

1434
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,336
This is a mistake.
It's a setup. It's the lynxes.

1435
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,037
Listen to me. Please.

1436
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,741
I know we have had
our differences, right?

1437
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:49,677
But I've always
respected you--

1438
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:53,113
You don't respect anyone.

1441

He's got
the rabbit's location.

1442
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:02,122
Whatever he says,
it's a lie, Hoggbottom.

1443
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:03,658
Hoggbottom, listen to me!

1444
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,759
Oh, God.

What are the chances? [laughs]

1448
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:19,239
You know, this is
my first time in prison,

1449
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:20,642
and I gotta say,

1450
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:23,310
their food is on point.

1451
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:25,747

1452
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,180

1453
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,383
Plus an arrest. [chuckles]

1454
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,485
But it looks like
Judith got away.

1455
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,623
Was that decision mutual?

Wanna talk about it?

1458
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,063
What I want
is to get out of here.

1459
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:44,566
[Nibbles]
Right, your big plan.

1460
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,735
Lay low on Outback Island
sipping piña koalas.

1461
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:50,638
Except you can't trust koalas,
'cause they got four thumbs.

1462
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:53,140
Did a whole episode about it
on my podcast.

1463
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:55,810
It was called
"They Got Four Thumbs."

1464
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,111
But you know what? At least
they ain't platypuses.

1465

-Wait. Can you just...

1466

just let me concentrate?

1467
01:08:01,649 --> 01:08:02,717

she said to you?

She, um...

1474
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:22,235
Uh, she said
maybe we are too different.

1475
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,805
[Nibbles] Hmm.

1476
01:08:23,938 --> 01:08:26,774
And what did you say
before that?

1477
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:29,242
I said the case
isn't worth dying for.

1478
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,344
Mmm.

1479
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,412
Like, uh...

1480
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:37,150
like, you know, as in it isn't
worth her dying for because...

1481
01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:41,355
because solitary animals
like me

1482
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,124
don't have real friends.

1483
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:48,596
And I... I...
I don't want to lose her.

1484
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,566
So, I just...

1485
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,702
I don't know how to say that.

1486
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:57,505
[Nibbles sighs]

1487
01:08:57,639 --> 01:08:59,741
You know what, bud?
I think you just did.

1488
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,275
Wait, how'd you do that?

1489
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:04,144
Well, I opened my arms,

1490
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,814
put them around you
and then I squeezed.

1491
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:10,384
It's called a hug.
Do foxes not have hugs?

1492
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:12,285
Oh! [laughs]

I'll help your friend.

And I didn't say it.

I should've said it.

1783
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:33,648
But I didn't

1784
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:35,550
because...

1785
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:38,520
uh, well... [chuckles]

1786
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:41,321

who's not good
at expressing his feelings.

1789
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,532
Probably because I've been
on my own my whole life.

1790
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:52,232
It's not an excuse.
It's just...

1791
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,769
It's why instead
of telling you

1792
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:58,105
that you're the best thing
that ever happened to me,

1793
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:01,141
I-I make jokes
about your ears.

1794
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:02,710
And-And I tell you
that you try too hard,

1795
01:24:02,844 --> 01:24:04,579
when, you know, the truth is

1796
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:07,749
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

1797
01:24:07,882 --> 01:24:10,183
Because... [breathes deeply]

1798
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:12,587
Because no one else
in the world

1799
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,523
matters more to me
than you do.

1800

[♪ sentimental music playing]

1801
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:20,193
I... I do try too hard
because deep down

1802
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:21,796
I'm afraid that I am
what everyone thinks I am.

1803
01:24:22,129 --> 01:24:23,565
And I suppress my discomfort
because I'm worried

1804
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:25,332
it makes me look weak,
and I wanna be strong,

1805
01:24:25,465 --> 01:24:26,601
and I think I'm failing
all the time.

1806
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:28,101
And I only take
what you say personally

1807
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:29,469
because you're
the only one in my life

1808
01:24:29,604 --> 01:24:31,138
who ever believed in me,

1809
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:32,674
even when I don't even
believe in myself.

1810
01:24:32,807 --> 01:24:34,642
[inhales deeply] And I
should have told you that.

1811
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,845
No one else in the world
matters to me

1812
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:39,413
more than you do either.

1813
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,717
I have unresolved
childhood trauma

1814
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,151
that I refuse to discuss

1815
01:24:44,284 --> 01:24:45,452
because being vulnerable
scares me.

1816
01:24:45,587 --> 01:24:47,187
I make dangerous choices

1817
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:49,122
because I have an unhealthy
bunny hero complex.

1818
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:50,758
And I didn't join the ZPD
because I wanted to be a cop.

1819
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:53,795
I joined because I always
wanted to be part of a pack.

1820
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:56,396
And the thought of losing you
scares me because...

1821
01:24:57,765 --> 01:24:59,166
because you're my pack.

1822
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,703
I should never have left you,

1823
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:03,638
and I do need
a herd of therapy animals.

1824
01:25:03,771 --> 01:25:06,239
And I should have told you
that you are the only partner

1825

[sobs] ...you're my fluffle.
