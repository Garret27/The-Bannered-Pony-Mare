00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,222
[man 1] Decelerate all portals.

183
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,726
-Ultraman's back.
-Ultraman!

184
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,312
[brightly] Ultraman!
You did so good.

185
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,771
[woman laughs] Yes!

186
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,692
[chatter and laughter]

187
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,466
Sorry about that. I'm so sorry.

188
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,675
Sorry.

189
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,638
-Morning, Nino.
-Good morning, Clark.

190
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,271
[man on tv] Do these
unelected met a humans

191
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,941
think they can dictate
international policy?

192
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,192
It's outrageous.

193
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,778
[Perry] It's a big story.
Put it above the fold.

194
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,404
That's where we put it.

195
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,949
-You're late again, Kent.
-Sorry, Perry.

196
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,035
-Hey, loser.
-Hey, Steve.

197
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,871
Hey, what do you got
against adverbs, Kent?

198
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,124
How are we supposed to know how we
feel when we read this malarkey?

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,462
In sports writing, you learn
the sentence is the modifier.

200
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,464
-Hey, Ma.
-"Ma!"

201
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,967
-Hey, Clark!
-[Pa chuckles]

202
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,719
Uh, me and Pa just
wanted to call

203
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,306
and say congratulations
on that front page.

204
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,308
Boy, that is something!

205
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,811
Hey, ask Ma if she barbecued
up any good roadkill lately.

206
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,355
-Shut up, Steve.
-Like, uh, possum or chitlins…

207
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,940
-What's that, Clark?
-[Clark] Sorry, Ma,

208
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,066
I'm just in the middle
of a big news day here.

209
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,150
What are chitlins?

210
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,694
Chitlins are intestines.

211
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,988
[Steve] Thanks, Cat.
You read this crud?

212
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,865
I thought it was great, Clark.

213
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,741
"Great"?

214
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,952
[chuckling] Yeah!
Front page! Big time!

215
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,831
Well, we don't want
to keep you, but, uh,

216
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,041
wanted to say congrats,

217
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,836
and tell you we're
thinking 'bout you, Clark.

218
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,214
-It's been a minute.
-Tell him don't be a stranger.

219
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,592
Pa says, "Don't be a stranger."

220
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,594
I, uh… Yeah, I heard him, Ma.

221
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,304
Yeah, okay I gotta
go. I gotta run.

222
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,638
Yep, okay. Love you.

223
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,267
So, this guy just flew into midtown
and started attacking people,

224
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,102
demanding for
Superman to show up?

225
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,146
Yeah. It's all
there in my article.

226
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,107
Then I'd actually have to make
it through your writing, Clark.

227
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,317
Knowledge is worth
many sacrifices.

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,193
That isn't one of them.

229
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,069
[Clark] Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny, Lois.

230
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,030
-Oh, my God.
-He's so fine.

231
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,074
Twenty-two people in the hospital,
over 20 million in property damage.

232
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,076
-It does make you wonder.
-Wonder what?

233
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,205
As great as he is, maybe Superman
didn't completely think through

234
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,832
the ramifications of
the Boravia thing.

235
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,083
If this guy is
even from Boravia.

236
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,336
[Jimmy] What do you mean? His
name is "the Hammer of Boravia."

237
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,755
Yeah, I doubt his parents
named him that, Jimmy.

238
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,924
We have no clue what his
actual goal was here.

239
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,385
I think it's pretty obvious the
goal was kicking Superman's ass.

240
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,429
Uh, he did... He didn't
completely kick Superman's ass.

241
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,471
[Jimmy] Pretty
thoroughly, Clark.

242
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,350
Show me! You show me
what ties there are

243
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,436
between Boravia
and this "Hammer!"

244
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,772
Yeah, see, Superman did say
he thought the, uh, Hammer

245
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,357
might be faking a
Boravian accent.

246
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,816
Superman said that?

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah, I interviewed him
right afterwards. Great guy.

248
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,073
You know, it's funny that you keep getting
all these interviews with Superman, Clark.

249
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,867
I don't think there's anything
funny about good journalism, Lois.

250
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,285
Uh-huh.

251
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:15,415
[Ghurkos] The relationship
between Boravia and United States

252
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,419
has been like iron for 30 years,

253
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,965
until Superman came along.

254
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,052
[Luthor] What you're
looking at, my friends,

255
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,806
is the most powerful
being on Planet Earth:

256
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,183
Ultraman.

257
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,185
You created this man?

258
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,355
Ooh. Check this
out. The Engineer.

259
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,983
A former special operative,
whose blood I infused

260
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,485
with microscopic machines
called "nanites,"

261
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,239
which she can form into
anything she can imagine.

262
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:52,035
And, of course, you're familiar with
my flying armored forces, the Raptors.

263
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,999
All together, they're an unstoppable
force we call PlanetWatch.

264
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,837
More than capable of containing
any otherworldly threat.

265
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,962
[snaps fingers]

266
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,466
So you want the
Defense Department

267
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,053
to hire your met a humans
to take down the Kryptonian?

268
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,724
After Superman acted with violence
against our Boravian allies,

269
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,850
I think it'd be
worth considering.

270
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,810
Big Blue stopped a war.

271
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,604
Naive, maybe, but
well-intentioned.

272
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,108
Well, I don't know the intentions of
an unattended firehose, General Flag.

273
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,485
I just do what I can
not to be splashed.

274
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,488
-Mr. Luthor…
-The disarming Director Crawley.

275
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,574
[sighs] The country of
Boravia has purchased

276
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,826
over 80 billion
dollars' worth of arms

277
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,995
from LuthorCorp in
the past two years.

278
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,788
-And?
-And no one would profit more

279
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,583
from a war with Boravia
and Jarhanpur than you.

280
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,960
A cynic might say that having
Superman out of the way

281
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,337
might not be bad for business.

282
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, what's particularly
bad for business is dying.

283
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,468
And I have a distinct feeling
that's where we're all headed

284
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,011
with the Kryptonian
running wild.

285
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,347
So we're gonna lock up
all met a humans now?

286
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,807
Look, other met a humans
aren't going off half-cocked,

287
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,601
interfering in foreign affairs.

288
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,937
They don't have... And
I have proof of this...

289
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,523
a hidden headquarters
in Antarctica

290
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,233
that violates 12
international treaties.

291
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,444
And they aren't aliens.

292
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,198
Shouldn't all that be
more than enough reason

293
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,910
for PlanetWatch to at least bring
the Kryptonian in for questioning?

294
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,038
Admittedly, I'm not comfortable

295
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,000
with a being from another planet
as dangerous as him on the loose.

296
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,461
But the optics?
Superman is popular.

297
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,047
Less so every day,
according to chatter online.

298
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,008
Not to mention the potential
risk of failing to contain him.

299
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,469
I assure you, Secretary,
we can contain him.

300
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,680
Yeah, they got this stuff, uh…

301
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,056
What's this Kryptonite
stuff called?

302
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,851
-It's called Kryptonite.
-Well, it kills him, right?

303
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,978
As far as we can ascertain,
there's none left on the planet.

304
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,813
I have a workaround
for that as well.

305
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,565
You know what? It
doesn't matter, Lex.

306
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,608
Because without solid
proof of malicious intent,

307
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,985
it's just not worth the risk.

308
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:49,653
[clicks]

309
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,321
[lock clicks]

310
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,128
[pots clatter]

311
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,755
[clattering continues]

312
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,264
[suspenseful music]

313
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,942
What are you doing here?

314
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,736
Three months ago, we
had our first date.

315
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,573
And so, to celebrate, I am
making you your favorite:

316
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,074
breakfast for dinner.

317
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,492
That's your favorite.

318
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,119
You love breakfast.

319
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,955
Yeah, for breakfast.
You love it for dinner.

320
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,391
[chuckles lightly]

321
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,310
-[chuckling] What?
-It was very funny today.

322
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,394
-What?
-It was hilarious,

323
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,813
the little back-and-forth
we had going.

324
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:06,563
Mm.

325
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,690
You giving me guff
for my article.

326
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,442
Jimmy was eating it
up. [loud kisses]

327
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,946
I wasn't acting, Clark. If you
keep interviewing yourself,

328
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,573
eventually people are
gonna figure it out.

329
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,991
But the glasses.

330
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,577
Yeah, they won't fool
everyone forever.

331
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,207
And ethically, these interviews
are hugely problematic.

332
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,210
I mean, y-you literally know
the questions in advance.

333
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,569
Okay, so I'll let
you interview me.

334
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm pretty sure you
wouldn't like that.

335
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,842
Come on, Lois. I'm media savvy.

336
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:38,387
I can handle any question
that comes my way.

337
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,138
Are you being serious right now?

338
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:41,931
Yeah.

339
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,685
You'd let me interview
you as Superman?

340
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,354
Sure.

341
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,773
How about now?

342
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,901
Um…

343
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
[beeps]

344
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,530
[Lois] Ready?

345
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,199
Let's do it, Cronkite.

346
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,243
Superman.

347
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,287
Miss Lane.

348
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,372
Recently, you've come under

349
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,457
a lot of fire for
what some might...

350
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,457
I don't know if it's
a lot of fire, but...

351
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,792
It's a lot.

352
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,127
Today the Secretary of Defense

353
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,504
said he was gonna look into
your actions in Boravia.

354
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,715
-[exhales]
-That... That's funny?

355
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,634
It's not "funny"
funny, it's just, um…

356
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,262
I mean, come on. My
actions? I stopped a war.

357
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,890
-Maybe.
-Uh, not "maybe." I did.

358
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,850
Okay. How?

359
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,686
Well, Boravia invaded Jarhanpur,

360
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,938
and I showed up and told
them that wasn't right.

361
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:30,689
And?

362
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,025
And… smashed some
tanks and things

363
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,986
and a couple of planes
and some other stuff.

364
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,448
There were no casualties
and no significant injuries.

365
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,574
Did you interact at all

366
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,035
with the President of
Boravia, Vasil Ghurkos?

367
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,411
A very small amount.

368
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,913
What's a very small amount?

369
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,831
That was between us.

370
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,792
[beeps]

371
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,002
This is all on the record.

372
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,547
Yeah, but that conversation
was between the two of us.

373
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,508
Yeah, and I would
ask that question

374
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,259
whether or not I knew
the answer to it.

375
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,761
-Really?
-Really.

376
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,429
[beeps]

377
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,389
After I stopped the war,

378
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,433
I went to see Ghurkos.

379
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:07,518
Where?

380
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,645
In the capital of Luchebic,
at the Royal Palace.

381
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,395
And?

382
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,648
And I took a private
audience with Ghurkos.

383
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,524
How?

384
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,151
I flew him out to
the desert, and I…

385
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,986
And you…

386
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,030
And I placed him
against a cactus.

387
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,740
A cactus?

388
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,825
So… torture?

389
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:24,785
No. Not torture.

390
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,912
Its spikes were like…
not even that big.

391
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,205
What did you say?

392
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,124
I told him that if he ever
messes with Jarhanpur again,

393
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,793
he'll have to
personally answer to me.

394
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,253
What did you mean by that?

395
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,838
That if such events occurred,

396
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,423
we would have a more serious
discussion, that's all.

397
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,968
More serious than tearing
up his back on a cactus?

398
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,178
Ghurkos was gonna kill people.

399
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,554
You seem to keep
forgetting that...

400
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,139
So, in effect, you
illegally entered a country,

401
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,558
inserting yourself in the middle

402
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,851
-of an incredibly heated…
-No, no, no. Hold on.

403
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:49,935
-Geopolitical situation…
-Hold on a second.

404
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,562
…siding with a
nation, Jarhanpur,

405
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,021
which historically has not been

406
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,607
-a friend to the US…
-Jarhanpur has changed.

407
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,484
…against a nation that's
technically our ally,

408
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,735
and then threatened to
murder their head of state.

409
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,405
First of all, whether or not
Jarhanpur is an imperfect country

410
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,282
does not give another nation
the right to invade it.

411
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, but the Boravian
government maintains

412
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,285
they're freeing
the Jarhanpurians

413
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,411
from a tyrannical regime.

414
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,121
Yes, but you know
that's very silly.

415
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,038
I do?

416
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,208
The Boravian government, of
all people, is saying this?

417
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,001
Come on!

418
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,669
This is on the record, Superman.

419
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,129
Now... No. Now, see…

420
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,589
Now you're being
dishonest, Lois.

421
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,424
How am I being dishonest?

422
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,302
-What are you...? Stop.
-Where's the button?

423
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,429
You're being dishonest because
you know as well as I do

424
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,972
that the Boravian government
is not well-intentioned.

425
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,434
I think that's almost certainly
the case, but do I know that?

426
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,517
No, I don't.

427
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,021
Can we go on now?

428
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,731
Yeah, fine.

429
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,982
-I don't... You do it.
-I…

430
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,811
You think this is going well?

431
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,197
Do I think this
is going well? Um…

432
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,616
I think I'm doing a good job.

433
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,327
[beeps]

434
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,079
Superman, did you consult
with the President

435
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,496
before entering
Boravian airspace?

436
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,081
[sighs]

437
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,750
-No.
-The Secretary of Defense?

438
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,543
-No.
-Or any US official

439
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,378
before you took matters
into your own hands

440
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,255
and decided unilaterally
how to handle

441
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,340
this extremely
delicate situation?

442
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,051
Ghurkos and his goons
were going to kill people.

443
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,427
Yes, but the results

444
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,638
of you seemingly acting
as a representative

445
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,597
of the United States will cause…

446
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,640
I wasn't representing anybody…

447
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:10,432
…more problems around the world.

448
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,266
…except for me, and-and…

449
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,269
-More than a war that lasted…
-…myself and, and, and…

450
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,144
…between 12 and 24 hours…

451
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,103
…good, I don't know, doing good.

452
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,522
…and was just replacing

453
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,023
one tyrannical
regime with another?

454
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,399
Is that really how you feel?

455
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:22,611
I'm not the one being
interviewed, Superman, but…

456
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,988
I question it.

457
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,741
Yeah, I would question
myself in the same situation

458
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,452
and hold off a beat and
consider the consequences.

459
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,538
People were going to die!

460
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,043
[exhales]

461
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,384
Okay, I'd like to change
the subject, if I could.

462
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,261
Okay.

463
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,471
You've gotten a lot of heat
on social media lately.

464
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,597
I don't read that stuff.

465
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,766
Superman doesn't have
time for selfies.

466
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,435
-Third person?
-Hmm?

467
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,480
You're referring to yourself
in the third person now?

468
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,773
No, it was just a
thing I came up with

469
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,816
that I thought I'd try to
work into the next interview.

470
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,151
This is on the record, Superman.

471
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,778
Okay, well, not the
part where I said that.

472
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,321
-Yes, that part.
-No, that part was an aside.

473
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,322
That was off the record.

474
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,158
You have to say "off the
record" beforehand, not after.

475
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,702
Why are you being like this?

476
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,036
Fine, I-I won't write

477
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,498
that you spend your spare time
trying to think up soundbites.

478
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,874
Which are terrible, by the way.

479
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,209
-Social media.
-Yes.

480
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,336
As you may know,
or maybe you don't,

481
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,214
since you claim not to
read any of that stuff...

482
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,089
Very seldomly.

483
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,841
Maybe sometimes people
catch you reading it

484
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,467
and looking very upset.

485
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,136
Okay, well, you can't use that.

486
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,264
People on social media are
suspicious because you are…

487
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,474
…an alien, yes?

488
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,559
Yes.

489
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,145
I've been very honest about
that. From the beginning.

490
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,522
I come from a planet
called Krypton.

491
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,150
-Okay.
-Which is gone now, by the way.

492
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,736
Destroyed. Along with
all of my history.

493
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,571
My parents.

494
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,489
They sent me here as a
baby to save my life.

495
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,616
Here, where?

496
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,899
I'm not gonna say that. You
know I'm not gonna say that.

497
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,454
Okay.

498
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,711
What do you know about these
biological parents of yours?

499
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,465
Just that they sent me
here to serve humanity

500
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,968
and to help the world
to be a better place.

501
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,095
-They said that?
-They did.

502
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,349
They sent a message
along with me.

503
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,062
That message is
why I do what I do.

504
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,855
I cherish it more than anything.

505
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,608
Because you understand now,

506
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,818
there are an awful lot of
people out there maintaining

507
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,072
you're here for more
nefarious purposes.

508
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,282
Hashtag Superspy.
Hashtag Supershit.

509
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,951
Supershit!? Come on, Lois!

510
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,619
You know that one
specifically irritates me!

511
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,871
This is on the record, Clark!

512
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:38,872
-[recorder beeps]
-I didn't make it up.

513
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:40,958
It's what people on the
Internet are saying.

514
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,668
I'm gonna go.

515
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,545
-Really?
-Yeah.

516
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,588
Come on, Clark. Don't do this.

517
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,798
[Clark] I'm not doing anything.

518
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,800
No? No, that's not you,
packing up your shit

519
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,343
and walking out of an interview?

520
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,636
I'm not walking out
of an interview,

521
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,804
-I'm just... It's late.
-No, this is what you do

522
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,014
every time you're
faced with conflict.

523
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,307
-I'm not doing anything.
-You get mad. You pout.

524
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,475
-Then you pretend…
-I'm not mad.

525
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,059

00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,929
Come on, bro. Don't
be such a wuss.

709
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,599
'Ey! Just another day in the
life of the Justice Gang!

710
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,725
-[scattered applause]
-Not our name.

711
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:47,935
It's just a working name.

712
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,645
Could very well prove
to be permanent though.

713
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,855
-Probably not!
-Good chance though, I'm saying.

714
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,357
[laughing] You okay?
Everybody okay?

715
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,525
[Green Lantern] Just
like to say thank you

716
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,444
on behalf of LordTech Industries
for the opportunity...

717
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,363
[smacking gum]

718
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,739
Why is nobody clapping?

719
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,157
[murmuring]

720
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,665
Come here.

721
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,417
This has to be BS.

722
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,670
[scattered chatter]

723
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,130
[host] Well, they
couldn't be mistaken?

724
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:16,880
[Luthor] Oh, no.

725
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,383
Well, that sounds
very disturbing, Lex.

726
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,968
Twenty-eight of the
world's top linguists

727
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,303
have confirmed the translation

728
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,472
and 30 of the top
forensic computer techs

729
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,559
have confirmed the validity
of the footage itself.

730
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,143
Any chance they're mistaken?

731
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,646
Unfortunately, no.

732
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,648
-[host] You have the footage?
-Yes.

733
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,607
[host] Let's take a look.

734
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,651
[Jor-El speaking Kryptonian]

735
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,112
[male translator] We love you
more than heaven, our son.

736
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,738
We love you more than land.

737
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,868
Our beloved home is
soon to be gone forever.

738
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,454
[female translator] But
hope vitalizes our hearts,

739
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,914
and that hope is you, Kal-El.

740
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,793
We have searched the universe

741
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,794
for a home where you
can do the most good.

742
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,630
And live out Krypton's truth.

743
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,091
[male translator]
That place is Earth.

744
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,592
I don't get it.
What's bad about that?

745
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:05,012
[Kryptonian continuing, warbles]

746
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,097
[male translator] The
people there are simple

747
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,057
and profoundly confused.

748
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,020
Weak of mind and
spirit and body.

[Jor-El speaks Kryptonian]

750
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,148

Lord over the planet

751
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,858
as the last son of Krypton.

752
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,152
[Lana speaks Kryptonian]

753
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,278
[female translator]
Dispatch of anyone

754

unable or unwilling
to serve you, Kal-EI.

755
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,910
Take as many wives as you can,

756
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,038
so your genes and
Krypton's might and legacy

757
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,998
will live on in
this new frontier.

758
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,375
[Jor-El speaks Kryptonian]

759
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,461
[male translator] Do us
proud, our beloved son.

760
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,379
Rule without mercy.

761
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,716
But what about all the kind acts

762
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,718
Superman has performed
over the years,

763
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,595
saving countless lives?

764
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,848
No. He's grooming us.

765
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,351
Lulling us into complacency,

766
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,062
so he can dominate
without resistance,

767
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,688
forging a path for his

768
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:59,191
super-powered descendants
to rule the Earth.

769
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:05,739
I will not accept
that. Will you?

770
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:11,411
-You seem upset.
-[scoffs] I'm…

771
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,288
I'm scared.

772
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,708
I will admit that, I am scared.

773
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:23,131
Because who knows how large
his secret harem is already?

774
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,595

[woman] Oh, hell no!
Let me in! I'm serious!

[warbles]

780
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,163
Dude, you got a secret harem?

781
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,707
No, Guy, of course I
don't have a harem.

782
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,585
If any of that message
is even remotely true,

783
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,462
then you are exactly
the kind of alien threat

784
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,798
I was commandeered by
the Green Lantern Corps

785
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,383
to protect this planet against.

786
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,428
-Back off, Guy!
-Oh.

787
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,264
-Make a move, Big Blue.
-[breathing deeply]

788
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,183
Guy, relax.

789
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,894
Was the message real or not?

790
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,856
[inhales] The first half.
The first half is… is real.

791
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,399
The second half was damaged

792
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:24,359
in the t-trip from
Krypton to Earth.

793
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,612
-So it's-it's gotta be doctored.
-No way, Clark.

794
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,739
I know these computer
forensics guys.

795
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,409
They're not gonna say it's
legit unless they are sure.

796
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,828
I'm so sorry, man,

797
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,705
but there's no way
that message is fake.

798
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,023
Where'd they get
the footage though?

799
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:46,548
[wind whipping]

800
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,432
Are you considering bringing
Superman in for questioning?

801
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:59,102
We're talking with the President,
and we are reviewing our options now.

802
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,396
I'm sorry, but I have
to go, Miss Lane.

803
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,119
[Lois] And if you did,
when would that...

804
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,106
You buying this?

805
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,858
I don't put anything
past Luthor, Rick.

806
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,986
But the message is authentic.

807
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,782
If the Kryptonian is a
danger, we have to act.

808
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,367
I was a big Superman fan.

809
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,869
I supported him all the
time online and stuff,

810
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:15,994
but now?

811
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,121
I mean, I hope he rots in hell.

812
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,289
I don't care. You're
supposed to get out!

813
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,248
[Perry] Get me some pictures.

814
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:20,290
[man] We have a deadline!

815
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,375
Where is he? Get there now!

816
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,292
Don't call me Chief.

817
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,836
Okay. I'm gonna do my job.

818
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,088
It's no wonder the Kryptonian

819
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:30,133
interfered with
Boravia's interests.

820
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:34,972
Boravia wants to save
the people of Jarhanpur.

821
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,600
And Superman wants to
keep them enslaved!

822
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:44,481
[chuckles] Also,
from what I hear,

823
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:50,654
he finds Boravian women the
most physically attractive

824
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:55,492
and wants to add them
to his secret harem.

825

-[chuckles]
-[press shouting]

826
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,955
I have a question,
President Ghurkos.

827
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:01,915
Thank you.

828
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:07,087
[in Boravian] That couldn't
have gone better, Mr. President!

829
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,174
You were so handsome
and dynamic!

830
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,967
Wonderful!

831
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,761
Very handsome! Very handsome!

832
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,599
Go! Leave me be!

We did it, Lex!

838
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,308
I wouldn't celebrate until
the alien is off the board.

839
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,061
Oh, here. I brought you a
donut. From Dough's Holes.

Ridge, of all places.

841
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:09,358
The fake message,
a stroke of genius.

842
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,275
It's not fake.

843
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,111
He is here to kill
us. I knew it!

844
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:14,363
At Superman's fortress,

845
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,740
I hoped to get the knowledge
to help destroy him.

846
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,158
Little did I know,
his own parents

847
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,493
would be providing it.

Oh. [speaks Boravian]

849
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,454
Right? Yeah.

How did Luthor get in here?
It's keyed into my DNA.

856
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,441
Must protect Superman.

857
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,902

Well, yeah, that's
gonna become...

-Lex, I tried to stop him.
-[Luthor] It's fine, Heather.

Superman, we finally meet.

-Would you like a coffee or tea?
-Where's the dog?

867
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,108
Dog?

868
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,985
The dog, Luthor!
You took the dog!

869
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,737
That's right, Eve,
get all of this.

-Where's the dog?
-[Eve gasping]

I have no clue what
you're talking about.

873
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,877
[sighs] He's just a dog.

874
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:54,421
I don't know what dog
you're talking about.

875
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:55,905
[muffled in mug]
Ugly dog in a cape?

876
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:57,799
-What did you say?
-Hmm?

877
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,344
[gulps] I didn't say anything.

878
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:01,970
You heard what he said!

879
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,555
You heard him! He took him!

880
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,599
I mean, it seems to me,

881
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,937
that the only rabid animal
around here is Superman.

00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,539
-I love you.
-Love you.

[inhales] Krypto.

1065
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,201
[Luthor] How do you
contain a super dog?

1066
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,452
[panting]

1067
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,621
[Luthor] You beam super
squirrels into its brain.

[panting]

1069
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,333
We'll learn what we can.

1070
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:37,588
Then we'll put the varmint down.

1071
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,257
It will undoubtedly be painful.

1072
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,468
[man] Mr. Luthor,
please! I swear…

1073
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,305
[Luthor] This is our private
correctional institution.

1074
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,932
Yeah, most cells are
rented out to governments

1075
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,185
who want to keep
their incarcerations

1076
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,896
of political agitators private.

1077
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,565
Others are for more
personal transgressions.

1078
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,525
Fleurette wrote a blog about me.

1079
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,027
-[sniffling]
-There are few things I hate

1080
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,613
more than petty ex-girlfriends.

1081
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:04,865
You wouldn't be telling
me any of this if you...

1082
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:07,367
If we ever planned on
letting you out? No.

1083
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,660
[thud]

1084
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,163
[Luthor] You'd be terminated
already if it was up to me.

1085
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,207
First, the government has some
questions they want answered.

1086

You be sure to keep
our guest in check.

Little Joseph certainly
wouldn't want it any other way.

[machine whines]

1094
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:36,605

get the answers we need.

-[men chattering, indistinct]
-[sirens in distance]

1099
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,742
Come on over.

1100
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,965
-Hi!
-Hey, Eve.

1101
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:04,299
Oh, sorry we had to meet here,

1102
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,510
but Lex is always
accessing traffic cameras,

1103
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:07,386
so he knows where I am.

1104
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,555
I really don't understand why
you stay in that relationship.

1105
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,724
'Cause he made a point to tell
me about all his ex-girlfriends

1106
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,684
he had imprisoned in
his pocket universe.

1107
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,269
-What?
-Right?

1108
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:17,271
-How's your mom?
-My mom?

1109
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:18,397
Oh, I love her so much.

1110
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,066
I think of her as my mom,
even more than my own mother.

1111
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:22,651
Oh, she feels the same way,

1112
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,820
from the-the one time
that you guys met.

1113
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,280
-Yeah?
-So, hey. Okay.

1114
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,073
-Yes. Yes.
-Eve?

1115
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,533
There seems to be some
sort of connection

1116
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,785
between Boravia
and your boyfriend.

1117
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,029
-I'm not clear on what...
-Oh.

1118
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:34,328
What's wrong?

1119
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:35,831
-[sighs]
-What's "oh"?

1120
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,417
I thought you wanted
to see me, Jimmy.

1121
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,501
I do but, Eve,

1122
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,546
how could I even really see you
with Lex still in the picture?

1123
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,423
You're just trying to get
information out of me.

1124
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:45,633
I swear to God, that's not it.

1125
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,843
I-I just know that if I could
get some real dirt on him,

1126
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,469
then maybe the
two of us could...

1127
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,013
Could be together again?

1128
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:57,853
[whispers] Yeah.

1129
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,772
But you said my toes look like

1130
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,441
someone spilled shrimp
cocktail on the floor.

1131
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,651
You have unconventional
toes. Who cares?

1132
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:05,861
There's other parts of
you that people would

1133
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,654
find very attractive.

1134
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,489
Lex tortured a
dog the other day.

1135
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,201
-Jesus Christ!
-I know.

1136
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,952
-I have to go.
-Eve.

1137
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,371
Please see what
you can find out.

1138
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,791
-[both whispering] Okay.
-Yes! Yes!

1139
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:22,211
Okay.

1140
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,215
I'm-I'm putting
'em in my pocket.

1141
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,966
[kisses] Okay.

1142
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:33,805
[cries]

1143
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:40,270
[gasps] Joseph. He's your son?

1144
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,355
Don't talk to me.

1145
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:42,814
Please.

1146
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,399
[gasps]

1147
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:48,278
I could fly over and get
him if you just... [panting]

1148
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,363
If you'd stop with
the Kryptonite.

1149
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,615
There's no way out of
here, okay? So, just…

1150
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,617
-There's always a way.
-I said don't talk to me!

1151
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,993
[screams]

1152
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:56,077
I told you.

1153
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:57,955
[flesh sizzling]

1154
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,498
Don't talk to me!

1155
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,550
[heroic music]

1156
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,885
[Guy] Yeah, so what
do you want me to do?

1157
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:11,969
Where's the creamer?

1158
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,887
[Hawkgirl] On the counter,
where it always is.

1159
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,974
He's in your group,
right? The, um, uh...

1160
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,976
-What's it called, again?
-The Justice Gang.

1161
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,561
-No.
-We're not called that.

1162
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,062
Yeah, your name is Mr. Terrific.

1163
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,689
You don't get a vote
with a name like that.

1164
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,649
I also voted against it.

1165
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,735
Yes. And as leader,
I get tiebreaker.

1166
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,779
No, Superman is not
officially a member.

1167
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:31,530
Because you don't
want him to vote.

1168
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,615
You know which
way that would go.

1169
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:33,907
Shut up. He's kidding.

1170
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:37,035
So, how do you even
know Superman anyway?

1171
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,080
I… just… do.

1172
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,748
So you know about
the hypno-glasses?

1173
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:42,958
Now she does.

1174
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,420
I'm not saying who he is, just
that he wears hypno-glasses.

1175
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:47,379
They make his face…

1176
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:48,506
Terrific, how do they work?

1177
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:50,048
They make his face
look different

1178
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,633
in your brain when
he wears them.

1179
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:52,718
So that you don't
know who he is.

1180
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,511
Yes, I know this, first of all.

1181
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,472
But, second of all, you really
shouldn't be telling me this

1182
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,974
in case I don't know who he is.

1183
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,309
So, you know he's Clark Kent?

1184
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,270
Oh, my God. Why does
he trust everyone?

1185
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:06,982
He doesn't. Just us because
we are also of the cloth.

1186
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,401
"Of the cloth?"

1187
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,114
-What are we gonna do?
-About what?

1188
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:17,201
Superman! He's your friend!

1189
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,536
Some friend. Came
here to rule over me?

1190
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,288
It would be difficult
to find him.

1191
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:25,667
I put nanobot GPS trackers
into Superman's bloodstream.

1192
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,336
You can see where his trail ends

1193
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,004
abruptly right here
at Fort Kramer,

1194
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,965
a dormant military post across
the river about ten miles down.

1195
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,676
Even if he was dead, those
trackers would still be there.

1196
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,386
So, all this leads
me to believe,

1197
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,721
as your article surmised,

1198
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,056
he really is in a
pocket universe.

1199
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,307
[keyboard clacking]

1200
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,477
You put nanobot GPS trackers
in your friend's bloodstream?

1201
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,020
Oh, I do that to everybody.

1202
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,148
So, okay. Come on. Let's
go to Fort Kramer then.

1203
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,942
The four of us, and find
out what's going on.

1204
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,027
And then do what?

1205
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,238
Save him.

1206
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,031
You wanna break a federally

1207
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,991
incarcerated
prisoner out of jail?

1208
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,660
Look, I think this is being done

1209
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,912
to keep him from interfering
with the Boravian invasion.

1210
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,414
No, you look. I'm a
Green Lantern, lady.

1211
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,000
That means I took a vow not
to get involved in politics.

1212
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,252
Oh, that's part of the vows?

1213
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:09,962
It's implied. Yeah.

1214
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,213
An implied vow?

1215
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:12,631
Every time there's something
he doesn't want to do,

1216
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:13,716
he says it's part of some vow.

1217
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:14,842
Oh, I swear to God.

1218
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:17,261
I am two seconds away from
forming a giant hammer,

1219
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,595
and beating you both to death.

1220
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:21,682
Is Supes here to
take over the world?

1221
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,100
I don't know. Probably not.

1222
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,018
But the risk is just
not worth the beef

1223
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:27,229
between the US government
and the Justice Gang.

1572
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,332
Such a jerk.

1574
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,163
But if I send you this, Jimmy…

1575
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:18,717
[exhales] Uh-huh.

1576
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:24,139
You have to promise me we
get to hang this weekend.

1577
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,683

1578

-Okay.
-Yeah? Okay! Yay!

Uh-huh. How, uh… How long?

-All weekend.
-[shouts] All weekend?

[Eve] Oh, my God, Jimmy!

1583
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:49,414
I'm sorry this is such a
major imposition on your life!

1584
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,042
No, it's not an imposition, I...

1585
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,710

-[Martha] Lois.

Here, Son.

1594
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:43,802
Hi, Ma.

1595
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,597
Ma, they sent me here
to rule over everyone.

1596
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:48,711
They sent me here
to kill people.

1597

Is our boy gonna be okay?

1601
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:23,467
Yes. Mr. Terrific says yes.

1602
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:27,554
Don't mind him, Lois.

1603
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,390
He's just a big ol' mush.

1604
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:33,101
Especially when
it comes to Clark.

1605
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:42,945
[phone vibrates]

1606
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,662
[Lois] This girl is
obsessed with you?

1607
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:52,746
[Jimmy] Uh-huh.

1608
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:54,873
How do you do it, Jimmy?

1609
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:56,208
Look, I didn't even
want to bother you,

1610
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,043
but you told me to call
with anything I got, so I...

1611
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,407
Yeah, but I thought you said
she disappeared off the line.

1612
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:02,423
I don't know. She might have
dropped her phone in the toilet.

1613
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:04,341
-She does that a lot.
-[sighs]

1614
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:07,845
Well, I'm not really sure
that sexy selfies are...

1615
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,483
Your hot ex is a genius.

1616
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:23,694
-Hot?
-We have to talk to Perry.

1617
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:25,529
I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

1618
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,326
[raptor] Sending sexy selfies
behind the back of Lex Luthor?

1619
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,829
She has to be the biggest
idiot in the world.

1620
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:36,915
Lex, he just told you,
the portal was destroyed!

1621
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:38,292
The dimensional
aperture is still there…

1622
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,084
Syd, tell him!

1623
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:40,252
…which we can open
remotely, so open it.

1624
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,129
It is not… safe!

1625
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:43,839
We can close the aperture later

1626
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,591
by inputting the
coordinates, correct?

1627
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,176
-Theoretically.
-Great!

1628
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:52,055
If we can't find him,
we'll need to draw him out.

1631
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:13,452
But Lex, that could tear

1632
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,079
a dimensional rift into
the surrounding area!

1633
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,165
This is something you
think I don't know?

01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:25,422
-That shouldn't happen.
-Oh, you don't say!

01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:29,801
-Can you… Can you stop it?
-Can I stop it?

1638
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:39,978
This is why you don't create
a damn pocket universe.

1639
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,898
[Luthor] There. Superman
won't be able to ignore that.

1640
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,069
Now we know where he'll be next.

1647
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:31,363
Thought you was
out here. [sighs]

1648
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:33,739
Hey, Pa.

1649
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:37,411
[chuckles] Never seen
you sleep that long.

1650
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,879
Last week me, Ma,
Hector and them,

1651
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,299
we took a drive to
Beerki's Burritos

1652
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:51,758
down in Luttus.

1653
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:55,721
Like the one that used to be
out by that old, uh, blue barn,

1654
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,556
out on that I-9,
you remember that?

1655
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:02,853
-Mm-hmm.
-Burritos still just as good.

1656
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,068
That Louanne, she...
she seems nice.

1657
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:12,988
-It's Lois.
-Hmm?

1658
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,448
Her name's Lois.

1659
01:25:15,073 --> 01:25:16,783
But yeah, she's… she's nice.

1660
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:21,163
But you don't seem
quite yourself.

1661
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,792
Yeah, well, that message
that my parents sent with me,

1662
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,961
I had never heard the
second half before.

1663
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:33,217
Well, I'd say what you
wanted that message to mean

1664
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,177
says a whole lot more about you

1665
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:38,305
than what anyone
meant for it to mean.

1666
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:39,973
Pa, you don't understand.

1667
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:45,479
I'm not who I thought I was.

1668
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,402
They sent me here
to hurt people.

1669
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,405
Parents aren't for
telling their children

1670
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:56,949
who they're supposed to be.

Your choices, Clark.

Your actions.

1677
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:26,436
That's what makes
you who you are.

1678
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:29,773
I'll tell you something, son.

1679
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,860
I couldn't be…

1680
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:39,867

from invading
Jarhanpur once again.

At first, I thought Eve was
just sending me selfies.

1742
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:44,927
to cede half of the
country to Lex Luthor

1743
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,720
once the invasion is complete.

1744
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:48,180
He wants to make himself king.

1745
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,390
-King?
-King.

1746
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,601
Should we really still
be standing here?

1747
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:55,479
Lois, you got that flying
saucer deal up on the roof?

1748
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:58,315
-Yup.
-Grant. Troupe.

1749
01:29:58,398 --> 01:29:59,859
-Come on.
-[Lois] Grab the board, Jimmy.

1750
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,861
-How many does it hold?
-Five, or six. Six.

1751
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:06,365
-Okay. Lombard, you too.
-[gasps] Oh, thank you.

1752
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,700
Why the hell would Lex
want half a desert?

1753
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:10,411
His cultish acolytes
believe he's gonna create

1754
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:12,454
a technologically
advanced utopia.

1755
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:13,288
Utopia?

1756
01:30:13,372 --> 01:30:14,457
There's a profit factor as well.

1757
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,333
I mean, the petroleum
deposits alone

1758
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,043
are worth multiples
of his investment.

1759
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:19,406
[Jimmy] Whatever
his motives are,

1760
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:20,796
we know Luthor did
everything he could

1761
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,256
to ruin Superman's reputation.

[Lois] Eve's photos show

1763
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:25,759
he was behind the whole
Hammer of Boravia scam.

1764

[Jimmy] And all the
bots stirring up

1765

1766
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:31,807
[Lois] Mr. Terrific believes
Luthor is also behind

1767
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,309
the spreading rift between
universes out there.

1768
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,312
All of it seems to be geared
toward stopping Superman

1769
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:38,635
from standing in the way of
the Boravian invasion, Chief.

Lex Luthor is in league

complicated to hack.
