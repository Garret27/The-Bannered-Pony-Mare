1
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,246
Come, come!

2
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,768
Please!

3
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,921
Aziz. Aziz.

4
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:12,963
Aziz, light!

5
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,644
Aziz, light.

6
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,048
Good.

7
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,648
We start again.

8
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,206
"When the three planets are in eclipse,
the black hole, like a door, is open.

9
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:28,927
Evil comes...

10
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,478
...spreading terror and chaos."

11
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,999
See the snake, Billy? The ultimate evil.

12
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,967
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

13
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,562
I got all the snakes.

14
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,845
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

15
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,283
Well, if this is the five...

16
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,525
...and this is the one...

17
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,767
Every 5000 years.

18
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,522
So I've got some time, then.

19
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:06,887
You bring them water.

20
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,319
Good boy. I will take it to them.

21
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,684
Go with God. Be safe from evil.

22
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,844
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

23
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,924
...gathering together the four elements
of life: Water, fire, earth, air...

24
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,801
...around a fifth one.

25
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,322
A fifth...

26
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:27,404
...element.

27
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,361
Forgive me, lord.

28
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,406
They already know too much.

29
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,963
Father.

30
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:41,444
How are you today?

31
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,565
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

32
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,517
Father, I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

33
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,964
It's the greatest find in history.

34
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,403
You must be parched.

35
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,287
Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry.

36
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,601
It's like a battle plan.

37
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,642
Here, the good. Here, the evil.

38
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,121
And here, a weapon against evil.

39
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,646
I'm going to be famous.

40
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,801
Then let us toast to your fame.

41
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,197
To fame.

42
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,004
<i>Salute.</i>

43
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,842
You can't drink a toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.

44
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,807
This I don't understand.

45
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,402
This could be something...

46
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,527
...prehistoric.

47
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,088
I don't know.

48
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,966
But wait.

49
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,563
Here.

50
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:56,518
Look, look.

51
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:08,528
They're here.

52
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,400
This man...

53
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,925
...this perfect being.

54
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,365
I know this is the key. I know it.

55
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,525
This divine light they talk about.

56
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,600
What is divine light?

57
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,158
Aziz, light!

58
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,966
Much better. Thank you.

59
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,402
My lord.

60
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:38,683
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I have ever seen.

61
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,043
Don't you think?

62
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you German?

63
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,686
Lord, I know he was about
to discover everything.

64
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,807
But there is no worry.
I was there in time.

65
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,927
Priest, you and those before you...

66
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,398
...have served us well.

67
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,321
But war is coming.

68
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:06,447
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.

69
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,522
This...

70
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,487
...is really amazing.

71
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,361
The fifth element.

72
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,120
Take the stones.

73
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:42,168
My lord...

74
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,958
...if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenceless when evil returns.

75
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,520
In 300 years, when evil returns...

76
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,520
...so shall we.

77
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,642
Oh, professor.

78
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:03,158
Professor.

79
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:10,798
Don't move!

80
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,048
I have a gun!

81
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,440
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

82
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,758
Friends?

83
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,205
Father, they've killed the professor!
They're monsters!

84
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:23,882
I'll explain everything.

85
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,407
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

86
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:27,763
I am your friend.

87
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,238
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

88
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:34,288
Please, put the gun down.

89
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,448
Billy, no!

90
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,038
Hurry! The wall is closing!

91
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,722
Here is your mission:

92
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,802
Pass your knowledge to the next priest
as it was passed on to you.

93
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:55,405
I will do as you command, but please,
hurry, you still have time.

94
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,480
Time not important.

95
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,038
Only life important.

96
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,638
I will fulfil my mission!

97
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,322
You can count on me!

98
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,728
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

99
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,722
- Anything yet?
- No, sir.

100
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,039
- Not even a temperature?
- The analysers have jammed.

101
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,518
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5000.

102
00:11:58,369 --> 00:11:59,688
Let's see it.

103
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,322
It's taking shape.

104
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:36,648
Send out a probe.

105
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,926
Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of the Federated Territories.

106
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,089
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

107
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,846
I saved this seat for you, Father.

108
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,083
President on the line.

109
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,398
We're in position.

110
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,527
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.

111
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:07,283
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

112
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:08,848
All the calibres are overshot.

113
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,761
<i>We're initiating</i>
<i>thermonucleatic imaging.</i>

114
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,523
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

115
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,964
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

116
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,118
Recommendation?

117
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,247
My philosophy is shoot first
and ask questions later.

118
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,684
I don't like uninvited guests.

119
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,204
- All right, then, Staedert...
- Mr. President?

120
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:31,124
<i>Priest Vito Cornelius,</i>
<i>expert of astrophenomenon.</i>

121
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:35,767
I have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

122
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,528
You have <i>20</i> seconds.

123
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,441
Imagine that this...

124
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,681
...thing is not anything
that can be identified...

125
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,965
...because it prefers not to be.

126
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,759
Wherever there is life,
it brings death...

127
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:59,358
...because it is evil. Absolute evil.
- One more reason to shoot first.

128
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:02,163
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

129
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,718
Shooting will only make it stronger.

130
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,959
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

131
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,127
Growth rate is at 27%.

132
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,042
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time.

133
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,599
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

134
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,078
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

135
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:29,161
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

136
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:30,842
You may fire when ready.

137
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,046
Up-front loading of a 1 20- ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

138
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,640
Its structure solidified on the surface.

139
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,358
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

140
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:49,408
The most terrible intelligence
imaginable, Mr. President.

141
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:54,405
1 20's loaded.

142
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,164
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded.

143
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,081
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,968
- I have a doubt.
- I don't, Mr. President.

145
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,406
What happened?
Can you hear me?

146
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:18,287
Staedert, what happened?

147
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,804
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to, sir.

148
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,083
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

149
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:30,648
It's moving towards the ship.

150
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,999
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

151
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,443
Nothing, sir.

152
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,804
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.

153
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:47,086
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

154
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:50,286
<i>Get out of there.</i>
<i>Can you hear me, Staedert?</i>

155
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,326
<i>Do you understand? Listen.</i>

156
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:53,968
This is the president.
That's an order.

157
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,159
<i>Do you understand me?</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

158
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,285
<i>Get out of there!</i>

159
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,246
Good God!

160
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,247
<i>Four a day.</i>

161
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,568
I'm trying.

162
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,047
<i>To quit is my goal.</i>

163
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,882
I'm up.

164
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,848
All right, I'm up.

165
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,237
God.

166
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,919
<i>Hey, dog brain, Finger</i> here.

167
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,284
- Hi, sweetie.
- <i>I love you too.</i>

168
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,360
<i>You haven't called me that</i>
<i>since basic training.</i>

169
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:08,601
- I was talking to the cat.
- <i>Oh, yeah, I forgot...</i>

170
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,237
<i>... you prefer your cat to the real thing.</i>

171
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,842
At least the cat comes back.

172
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:16,445
<i>Still pining for that two-timing slut?</i>
<i>There's millions out there.</i>

173
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,204
I don't want a million women.
I just want one.

174
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,288
The perfect one.

175
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,964
- <i>It don't exist, major.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

176
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,885
- <i>What?</i>
- I just found a picture of you.

177
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,402
- <i>How do I look?</i>
- Like shit.

178
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,968
<i>Must be an old picture.</i>

179
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,167
<i>Bring me your hack</i>
<i>for a six-month overhaul.</i>

180
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:36,558
- Negative.
- <i>ASAP.</i>

181
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,288
I don't need one.

182
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:41,964
<i>Who sat next to you for 1000 missions?</i>
<i>I know how you drive.</i>

183
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:46,441
Finger, I drive a cab now,
not a space fighter.

184
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:50,158
<i>Okay, so tell me. How many points</i>
<i>you got left on your license?</i>

185
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,399
<i>Major, how many points?</i>

186
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,888
At least 50.

187
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,404
<i>Know what?</i>
<i>You gotta learn to lie better.</i>

188
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:57,797
<i>See you tonight.</i>

189
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,719
<i>Welcome to paradise.</i>

190
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,481
<i>Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

191
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,482
<i>It's Ruby Rhod,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you live at 5...</i>

192
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,721
<i>... the winner of the super- green</i>
<i>Gemini Croquette Contest!</i>

193
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,961
<i>The winner will go with me</i>
<i>for two days to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

194
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,801
<i>So tune in to Radio Cosmos.</i>

195
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,881
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

196
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,323
<i>For a perfect world.</i>

197
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,039
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

198
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,564
Long enough.
Come on, give me the cash.

199
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,721
Is that a Z-140? Alleviated titanium.

200
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,198
Neurocharged assault model.

201
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,280
Good thing for me it's not loaded.

202
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,242
- What do you mean, it's not loaded?
- You have to...

203
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:47,243
...push that little yellow button
to load it.

204
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,367
Take your time.

205
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,527
Want me to...?

206
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,048
There you go.

207
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,120
Give me the cash!

208
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,681
That's a very dangerous gun.

209
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,966
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

210
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,686
You don't mind, do you? You sure?

211
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,807
No. Take it. I don't need it.

212
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,442
That's a very nice hat.

213
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:27,928
You like it?

214
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,764
God!

215
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,247
<i>Please enter your license.</i>

216
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes, just a minute.

217
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,202
<i>Welcome on board, Mr. Dallas.</i>

218
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,088
Good morning. Sleep well? Me too.

219
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,163
- I had a horrible nightmare.
- <i>Propulsion 2-X-4.</i>

220
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,928
<i>You have five points left</i>
<i>on your license.</i>

221
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,478
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.

222
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,601
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

223
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:03,923
Why not?

224
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,158
You have 48 hours.

225
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:16,401
That's the time it needs to adapt
to our living conditions.

226
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:18,480
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

227
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:21,925
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

228
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:26,966
...but to exterminate life.
All forms of life.

229
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,927
So you're telling me there's nothing
that can stop this.

230
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,321
There is only one thing.

231
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,564
<i>The Mondoshawan have in their</i>
<i>possession the weapon to defeat evil.</i>

232
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,640
Four elements...

233
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,120
...gathered around a fifth...

234
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:49,886
...supreme being, the ultimate warrior,
created to protect life.

235
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,961
Together they produce
the Light of Creation.

236
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:56,599
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

237
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:00,921
But if evil stands there...

238
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:03,643
Then what?

239
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,563
Then light turns to dark.
Life to death...

240
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,162
...forever.

241
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,879
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

242
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,558
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

243
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:21,718
Thank you.

244
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,801
<i>Permission to enter granted.</i>

245
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,322
Showtime.

246
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,682
We are lost.

247
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,528
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

248
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,641
Mr. Zorg's office.

249
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,003
<i>It's Aknot.</i>

250
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,446
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.

251
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,998
<i>The mission is accomplished.</i>

252
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:42,449
<i>You'll have what you ask ed for</i>
<i>in a few hours.</i>

253
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,118
Good. I'll meet you at my factory.

254
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,644
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

255
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,323
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

256
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:54,287
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

257
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,806
Three hundred years
of waiting, for nothing.

258
00:22:58,529 --> 00:22:59,962
Go get some rest.

259
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:01,324
No.

260
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:03,402
The Mondoshawan...

261
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,688
I am their contact on Earth.
They will come for me.

262
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:09,409
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

263
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,598
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

264
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,122
Any survivors?

265
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,563
Only one.

266
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,088
You call that a survivor?

267
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:24,285
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

268
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,407
- Have you identified it?
- The computer went off the charts.

269
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,288
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

270
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:32,917
...which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

271
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,967
This has 200,000 memo groups.

272
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:44,760
- Sounds like a freak of nature.
- Yeah, can't wait to meet him.

273
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:53,803
You okay? Over here.

274
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,040
Excuse me.

275
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:03,238
General, I want to show you something.

276
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,482
This is a normal human DNA chain.

277
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,685
You, me, anybody, right?

278
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,123
Watch this.

279
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,286
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

280
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:17,566
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

281
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:20,368
Almost like this being was engineered.

282
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,562
Is there any danger?

283
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:27,640
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

284
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,800
The cell is, for lack of a better word...

285
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:31,728
...perfect.

286
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,846
Okay, go ahead.

287
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,681
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

288
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,840
Otherwise, I turn him into cat food.

289
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:40,608
Activate it.

290
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,122
Tissue processing.

291
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:28,207
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.

292
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:35,481
This is the last phase.

293
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:39,608
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

294
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,168
That means growing skin.

295
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,683
Wonderful.

296
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:50,039
Reconstruction complete.

297
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:54,762
Remove the shield.

298
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:05,238
I told you. Perfect.

299
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:14,603
Thermal bandages.

300
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:23,001
I'd like to take a few pictures...

301
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,242
...for the archives.

302
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,520
- What's she saying?
- Activate the phonic detector.

303
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:40,761
Is that thing solid?

304
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,282
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

305
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,482
If you want out...

306
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,404
...you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

307
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:15,963
General alert.

308
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:42,922
Perfect.

309
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,961
Ladder on 18.

310
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,158
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

311
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:11,684
This way.

312
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:47,441
Lady, stay calm.

313
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,122
This is the police.

314
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,281
There's nowhere else to go.

315
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:55,237
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

316
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:56,967
Do you understand me?

317
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:01,483
She doesn't.

318
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,961
I think we need a flying unit.

319
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,242
<i>This is the police.</i>

320
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,559
<i>This is the police.</i>

321
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,725
We are processing
your identification.

322
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,278
<i>Put your arms up</i>
<i>and follow our instructions.</i>

323
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,083
She has no file.

324
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,242
She dove off.

325
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,082
<i>You just had an accident.</i>

326
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,127
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

327
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,685
You have one point left
on your license.

328
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,282
Look out!

329
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,677
Left!

330
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:30,000
I can't believe it. Shit.

331
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,042
Any survivors?

332
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,248
Hi.

333
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:48,318
Are you okay?

334
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,002
Boom.

335
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:18,524
Boom. Yeah, I understand "boom."

336
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,645
Bada boom.

337
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,997
Big. Big bada boom.

338
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:25,284
Big...

339
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:26,962
...bada big boom.

340
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:28,403
Big boom.

341
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:31,208
- Yeah, big bada boom.
- Bada boom.

342
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,678
Big boom. Big bada boom.

343
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,199
You're lucky you're not dead.

344
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:43,760
<i>This is a police control.</i>

345
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,649
<i>Please k eep your hands</i>
<i>on the wheel.</i>

346
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,687
<i>You have an unauthorized</i>
<i>passenger in your vehicle.</i>

347
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:51,680
<i>We are going to arrest her.</i>

348
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,441
Thank you for your cooperation.

349
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,962
Sorry, honey.

350
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,926
Looks like this is your ride.

351
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:58,124
Open the door.

352
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,082
Do what they say.

353
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:05,284
Sorry.

354
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,040
"Please...

355
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:31,200
...help."

356
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,882
I only got one point left on my license.

357
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,644
I need that to get back to the garage
and get a six-month overhaul.

358
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:38,488
You understand?

359
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,238
Can you please
open the passenger door?

360
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,160
Please...

361
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,440
...help.

362
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,482
I can't.

363
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,277
<i>I repeat...</i>

364
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,485
...please open the passenger door.

365
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:02,799
Yeah, yeah, sure.

366
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,243
Why not?

367
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,521
Thank you for your cooperation.

368
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,843
Help.

369
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,200
Finger's gonna kill me.

370
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,402
Emergency! Emergency!

371
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:38,161
<i>One point has been removed.</i>

372
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,320
Yes, I know!

373
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:47,121
This is so stupid.

374
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,559
<i>Assist in pursuit of yellow cab.</i>

375
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,321
Unit 47, we're on the way...

376
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,081
...as soon as we finish lunch.

377
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,800
Two golden menus.

378
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:04,320
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

379
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,602
Thank you so much.

380
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:13,279
And I'm definitely too thirsty.

381
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,519
Look out!

382
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,042
We got lucky.

383
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,797
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

384
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:32,958
Maybe it's two miles.

385
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:35,768
Hang on.

386
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:47,604
Look, lady, I only speak English
and bad English!

387
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,878
Run an ID.

388
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:57,522
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

389
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,524
- He's got a scan blocker.
- Means he's a car thief. Blast him.

390
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,281
I don't know what you did...

391
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:13,918
...but they are really pissed off!
Hold on!

392
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:32,481
We're safe for a while.

393
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,723
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

394
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,160
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

395
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:14,399
If I get to the fog, we'll be all right.

396
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:18,402
If we make the fog.

397
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:38,487
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

398
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:47,683
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down, if you don't mind.

399
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,084
Shit.

400
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:12,323
You okay?

401
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,443
Priest.

402
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,079
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

403
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:22,482
- Vito Cornelius.
- What?

404
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,401
Priest.

405
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:28,518
Yes?

406
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:31,239
I'm looking for a priest.

407
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,048
The weddings are one floor down.
Congratulations.

408
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:38,126
She's not my bride. She's my fare.

409
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,120
She's looking for Vito Cornelius.

410
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,120
The phone book said he lived here.

411
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:45,247
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

412
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,877
Nobody does.
No file, no ID, nothing.

413
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:50,040
She's got a tattoo on this arm.

414
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,761
Tattoo?

415
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,642
Fifth...

416
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,243
...element.

417
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,201
Finger's gonna kill me.

418
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,929
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

419
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,319
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

420
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:23,243
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking this bizarre language.

421
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,684
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

422
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,567
The ancient language...

423
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:30,721
...spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

424
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,962
- He's a she.
- You noticed that.

425
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,083
Yes.

426
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:44,319
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

427
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,161
Not a moment to lose. Wake her up.

428
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:51,449
But gently, because this woman is
mankind's most precious possession.

429
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:53,201
She is perfect.

430
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,003
Perfect.

431
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:06,923
More dignified.

432
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:08,602
Hey, lady...

433
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:09,997
...wake up.

434
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:25,002
You're right, I shouldn't have done that.
I was wrong to kiss you.

435
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:26,761
He said to wake you gently.

436
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,282
You're right.

437
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:33,487
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

438
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:35,164
Remember?

439
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,358
"Bada boom"?

440
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:38,922
"Big bada boom"?

441
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,889
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

442
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:44,438
I drive a cab. This is me.

443
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,122
Korben Dallas.

444
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,362
Korben. You understand?

445
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:50,999
Here. Take it, go ahead.

446
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,919
You can call me
when you learn English.

447
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:58,682
Just kidding.

448
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,442
What is your name?

449
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,003
You.

450
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,682
Korben.

451
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,126
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

452
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,124
Good.

453
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:17,001
That whole thing's your name?

454
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,686
Do you have...

455
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:22,043
...a shorter name?

456
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,123
Short.

457
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,403
Korben Dallas.

458
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,643
Leeloo.

459
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:36,844
Leeloo.

460
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,242
Korben, Leeloo.

461
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,161
Leeloo, Korben.

462
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,884
- You're sure she's a supreme being?
- Absolutely sure.

463
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,402
Old friends.

464
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,803
Yeah, you're right.

465
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:08,689
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

466
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,124
Korben Dallas.

467
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,001
Thank you for your help.

468
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:15,888
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

469
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,967
She's been on a long trip.

470
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:20,279
I know. I was there when she landed.

471
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:22,682
Wait, wait, Father.

472
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:26,205
She said something
I didn't understand.

473
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,044
- What does "ekto gamat" mean?
- "Never without my permission."

474
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:32,122
That's what I thought.

475
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:41,721
I shouldn't have kissed her.

476
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:50,524
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

477
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,279
How about some nice Thai food?

478
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,360
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

479
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:58,838
<i>Buddy, I'm waiting all day</i> here.

480
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:00,681
- Finger.
- <i>Where is the cab?</i>

481
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:04,524
- Car's running fine. Purrs like a kitten.
<i>- Fine. What "fine"?</i>

482
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:07,408
<i>I know you.</i>
<i>"Fine" ain't in your v ocabulary.</i>

483
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:09,764
<i>You can tell your old buddy Finger</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

484
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,408
<i>What? You save the planet?</i>

485
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:15,724
<i>You dinged the fender again.</i>
<i>That's it, right?</i>

486
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:19,405
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

487
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:22,606
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

488
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:24,603
<i>How big?</i>

489
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:34,441
Five-nine...

490
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:36,203
...blue eyes...

491
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:38,280
...long legs, great skin.

492
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:40,281
You know. Perfect.

493
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:42,042
I see.

494
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:45,884
<i>And this perfect fare, she got a name?</i>

495
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:49,406
Yeah. Leeloo.

496
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:57,803
What's she doing?

497
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,847
Learning our history,
the last 5000 years that she missed.

498
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:02,601
She's been asleep for a while.

499
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:17,361
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

500
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,598
You're right.

501
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:22,362
Chicken.

502
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:23,723
Good.

503
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:28,442
Chicken.

504
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:36,206
I'm really sorry to interrupt you...

505
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:37,722
...but the case...

506
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,722
...with the stones...

507
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:41,884
...where is it?

508
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:45,363
Stolen?

509
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:50,409
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

510
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:58,246
Excuse me, sir. The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

511
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,969
Is it possible to fire 500,000?

512
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:05,361
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

513
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:07,281
Fire one million.

514
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,440
But 500,000...

515
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:16,398
One million. Fine, sir.

516
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:18,481
Sorry to have disturbed you.

517
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:31,040
It's for the Supreme...

518
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,321
Sorry.

519
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:38,565
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

520
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:41,360
You just put it like that.

521
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:44,719
Yes, there was a man with a limp...

522
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,407
...came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

523
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,002
Said he was an art dealer.

524
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,561
What was his name?

525
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:58,081
I'm so bad with names.

526
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:07,445
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.

527
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:13,008
What did she say?

528
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,998
<i>She says she knows</i>
<i>exactly where they are.</i>

529
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:24,084
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

530
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:27,921
Aknot, is that you?
What an ugly face.

531
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,363
It doesn't suit you.

532
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,602
Take it off.

533
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:34,964
That's better.

534
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,847
Never be ashamed of who you are.

535
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:38,408
You're warriors. Be proud.

536
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:41,847
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

537
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:45,007
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

538
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,888
Your time for revenge is at hand.

539
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,447
The ZF-1.

540
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:56,365
It's light. The handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.

541
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:59,885
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

542
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:01,960
A word on firepower:

543
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:05,519
Titanium recharger, 3000-round clip
with bursts of 3 to 300.

544
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,408
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

545
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:10,604
One shot...

546
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:14,720
...and replay sends every
following shot to the same location.

547
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:24,359
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

548
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:26,004
Rocket launcher.

549
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:31,126
Arrow launcher with exploding
or poisonous gas heads.

550
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:35,003
Very practical.
Our famous net launcher.

551
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:37,842
The always-efficient flamethrower.

552
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:43,084
My favourite.

553
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:47,926
And for the grand finale,
the all-new ice-cube system.

554
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:59,440
Four full crates
delivered right on time.

555
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:04,083
And what about you, my dear Aknot?
Did you bring me what I asked you for?

556
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:06,967
Yes.

557
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,681
Magnificent.

558
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:18,798
This...

559
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:22,485
This case is empty.

560
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:26,165
- What do you mean, empty?
- Empty...

561
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:27,921
...the opposite of full.

562
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,287
This case is supposed to be full!

563
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,288
Anyone care to explain?

564
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,328
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

565
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:46,325
Who took another route.

566
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:50,448
She's supposed
to contact this person...

567
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:52,088
...in a hotel.

568
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:58,967
And she's looking
for the address. Easy.

569
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:02,004
Dot.

570
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,007
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

571
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:13,329
- We're saved.
- I'm screwed.

572
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,719
You asked for a case.
We brought you a case.

573
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:18,164
A case with four stones in it!

574
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:20,524
Not one or two or three,
but four!

575
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:21,838
Four stones!

576
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:24,682
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

577
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,965
We are warriors, not merchants.

578
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:30,166
But you can still count!
It's easy. Look at my fingers.

579
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:31,728
Four stones, four crates.

580
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,642
Zero stones, zero crates!

581
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:37,644
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

582
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:42,040
We risked our lives.

583
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:45,997
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

584
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:50,128
So you are merchants after all.

585
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,009
Leave him one crate for the cause.

586
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:59,528
I don't like warriors.
Too narrow-minded, no subtlety...

587
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:02,761
...and worse, they fight
for hopeless causes, honour.

588
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:05,682
Honour's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

589
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,204
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.

590
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:11,725
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean and methodical.

591
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:13,800
A real killer picking up the ZF-1...

592
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,245
...would've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

593
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:36,363
Bring me the priest.

594
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,164
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

595
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,762
...and a blueprint of the hotel.

596
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,081
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

597
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:48,718
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

598
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:52,086
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

599
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,648
But there must be a way.

600
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,037
I'll get it.

601
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:03,638
Weddings?

602
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:07,238
Not really.

603
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:10,128
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Mister who?

604
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:11,802
Mr. Zorg.

605
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,604
Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel...

606
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:15,758
...Zorg.

607
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:21,319
It's nice to see you again, Father.

608
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:23,764
I remember you now.

609
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,717
The so-called art dealer.

610
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:30,802
I'm glad you got your memory back,
because you're gonna need it.

611
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,282
Where are the stones?

612
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,286
I don't know. Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell someone like you.

613
00:51:38,649 --> 00:51:39,718
Why?

614
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,441
- What's wrong with me?
- I try to serve life.

615
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:46,321
But you only...

616
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:48,526
...seem to want to destroy it.

617
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,281
Father...

618
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:54,161
...you're so wrong. Let me explain.

619
00:51:58,049 --> 00:51:59,960
Life, which you so nobly serve...

620
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:02,802
...comes from destruction, disorder
and chaos.

621
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,527
Now, take this empty glass.

622
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:07,283
Peaceful, serene, boring.

623
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,201
But if it is...

624
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:11,408
...destroyed...

625
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:17,598
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

626
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,078
Notice how each one is useful.

627
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:26,604
What a lovely ballet ensues,
so full of form and colour.

628
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,000
Now, think of all those people
that created them.

629
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:34,444
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

630
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,238
...so those children can grow up
and have children of their own...

631
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:39,762
...and so on and so forth.

632
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,807
Thus adding to the great chain...

633
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:44,722
...of life.

634
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:48,647
<i>Water. Fruit.</i>

635
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:51,528
You see, Father, by creating
a little destruction...

636
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:52,678
<i>A cherry.</i>

637
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:54,646
...l'm, in fact, encouraging life.

638
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:57,848
In reality, you and I
are in the same business.

639
00:52:58,809 --> 00:52:59,798
Cheers.

640
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:18,325
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

641
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:21,004
Or the engineer?

642
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:28,723
Or their children, maybe?

643
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:41,328
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

644
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:46,326
How your entire empire
of destruction comes crashing down...

645
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,482
...all because of one, little cherry.

646
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:04,841
You saved my life...

647
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,125
...and in return, I'll spare yours...

648
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:08,838
...for now.

649
00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:10,763
You're a monster, Zorg.

650
00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:14,247
I know.

651
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:20,568
Torture who you have to,
the president, I don't care.

652
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:22,447
Just bring me those stones.

653
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,721
You have one hour.

654
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,647
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

655
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:44,403
Why in the hell
is it eating up all the satellites?

656
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:46,287
We're working on it, Mr. President.

657
00:54:57,529 --> 00:55:01,488
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

658
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:03,879
And the stones? Did you find them?

659
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:06,279
- They weren't on board.
- What?

660
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:09,168
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

661
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:11,081
<i>They gave them</i>
<i>to someone they do trust.</i>

662
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:14,807
<i>Her name is Plavalaguna.</i>
<i>She's a diva.</i>

663
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:18,166
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

664
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:19,921
She has the stones with her.

665
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:22,438
The Mondoshawans will help.

666
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:25,646
All we have to do is send someone
to get the stones.

667
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:26,798
Excellent.

668
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:31,918
I want this operation to be
discreet as possible.

669
00:55:32,089 --> 00:55:34,125
No troops. No big operation.

670
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,725
I want your best man
to go undercover.

671
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,641
I have the perfect one.

672
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,400
You got a message.

673
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:46,446
Not gonna open it?
Could be important.

674
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:49,685
Like the last two were important.

675
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:53,320
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

676
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:57,198
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

677
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:59,288
That is bad luck.

678
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:00,677
But grandfather say:

679
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:04,159
"It never rain every day."
This is good news, guaranteed.

680
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:06,278
I bet you lunch.

681
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:08,637
Okay.

682
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,684
Come on.

683
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:16,204
"You are fired."

684
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,679
Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,563
At least I won lunch.

686
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:30,768
Good philosophy.
See good in bad. I like.

687
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:32,607
- Hello.
- <i>Korben, sweetheart.</i>

688
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:35,040
<i>You got brok en fingers?</i>
<i>You can't punch my number?</i>

689
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:37,200
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Seventeen messages.</i>

690
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:40,679
<i>Don't say your machine is</i>
<i>brok en again. They last 1000 years.</i>

691
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:44,205
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This'll take a minute.

692
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:47,088
<i>You don't feed your cat a croquette,</i>
<i>who you love more than</i> me.

693
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:49,479
<i>- She didn't breast-feed you. I did.</i>
- Goodbye, Mr. Dallas.

694
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:52,522
Good fortune for you.

695
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:55,522
<i>You don't have a girl.</i>
<i>I'll never be a grandmother.</i>

696
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:57,919
- It bring you good luck!
- Yeah, sure.

697
00:57:07,569 --> 00:57:10,720
What are you talking about?

698
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:14,524
No, all I want is an explanation.
I just got in.

699
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:17,362
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

700
00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:20,680
Besides that, everything's peachy.
Thanks for asking.

701
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:23,678
Now, settle down
and explain this to me.

702
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:37,481
If I'd won a trip, I'd know.
I would've been notified.

703
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,204
I'll call you back.

704
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:54,886
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

705
00:57:56,649 --> 00:57:58,128
Nice apartment, major.

706
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:01,919
You've settled into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.

707
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,642
You heard that?

708
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:08,164
Don't worry. I'll get another job.

709
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:10,285
Don't bother. We have one for you.

710
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:13,443
"Major Dallas, you've been
selected for a mission."

711
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:15,679
- What mission?
- To save the world.

712
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:18,247
"You leave for Fhloston Paradise.

713
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:22,084
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

714
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:24,764
- Any questions?
- Yeah, just one. Why me?

715
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:27,841
- I retired six months ago, remember?
- Three reasons.

716
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:31,997
One, as a member of the Elite
Special Forces Unit of the army...

717
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:35,241
...you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

718
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:39,121
Two, you're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

719
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:41,405
- The third?
- Of all the members of your unit...

720
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:43,480
...you're the only one left alive.

721
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:46,598
- Check your messages?
- I've had enough good news.

722
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:48,203
Might be important.

723
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:51,878
<i>You're a winner!</i>

724
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:55,200
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

725
00:58:58,289 --> 00:58:59,563
Here are your tickets.

726
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:01,647
You rigged the contest?

727
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:03,408
Congratulations.

728
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:07,567
You couldn't be more discreet?

729
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:09,799
Old tricks are the best tricks.

730
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:12,642
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

731
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:16,804
I am not going.

732
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,198
Why not?

733
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:31,362
Excuse me, general.

734
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:35,565
Who is it? Who is it?

735
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:39,847
- My wife.
- You remarried?

736
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,807
Yes. No. I just met this girl,
but I'm gonna marry her.

737
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:44,800
I love her,
but she hates the military.

738
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,766
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

739
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:49,602
She can't have anything to do with it.
If she sees you, she'll kill me.

740
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:51,367
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.

741
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:55,078
- You've gotta help me.
- We'd love to, but where can we hide?

742
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:02,126
- We don't have time for this.
- It's just for one minute.

743
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:04,240
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

744
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:06,400
No idea... You have no idea.

745
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,799
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

746
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:11,119
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

747
01:00:13,129 --> 01:00:14,767
Major!

748
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:16,397
You're on my foot.

749
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:17,843
Major! Major!

750
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:27,328
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...

751
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:29,047
Dallas.

752
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,326
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

753
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,281
Is this the way priests vacation?

754
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:37,441
- Not vacation. We're on a mission.
- What kind?

755
01:00:38,129 --> 01:00:40,199
We have to save the world, my son.

756
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,966
- You're gonna save the world?
- Yes!

757
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:50,405
Down there. Down there.

758
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,363
<i>This is a police control.</i>

759
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:03,078
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>

760
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,599
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

761
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:09,608
Just stay here for one minute.

762
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:12,647
<i>- This is a police control.</i>
- Don't touch anything.

763
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,198
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>

764
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,837
<i>Can you please spread your legs...</i>

765
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,728
<i>... and place your hands</i>
<i>in the yellow circles.</i>

766
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,039
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

767
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:24,437
Yeah, but l...

768
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:28,324
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

769
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,604
Let's see it.

770
01:01:34,129 --> 01:01:35,721
Are you classified as human?

771
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,449
Negative. I am a meat Popsicle.

772
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:42,284
I found him.

773
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:44,208
<i>Mr. Korben Dallas?</i>

774
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:48,479
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

775
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:53,161
Smoke you!

776
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:55,687
Wrong answer.

777
01:01:58,249 --> 01:02:00,968
<i>The police control</i>
<i>is now terminated.</i>

778
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:05,165
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

779
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:08,048
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy, but we bagged him.

780
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:10,439
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

781
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,648
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

782
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:17,927
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

783
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:20,478
...and I'll be in Fhloston in four hours.

784
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:23,079
Don't come back without the stones.

785
01:02:39,729 --> 01:02:41,321
Korben Dallas. We got him.

786
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:42,558
Perfect.

787
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:44,685
Akanit, take command.

788
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:47,678
Go to Fhloston and get the stones.

789
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:49,601
If Zorg really wants them...

790
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:51,839
...he'll have to negotiate.

791
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:54,443
Revenge is at hand.

792
01:02:57,609 --> 01:03:01,807
Oh, I am so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.

793
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:04,166
There's an autowash
in that shower.

794
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:11,401
I'm so sorry.

795
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:12,844
Autowash.

796
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:15,728
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

797
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:19,723
It's funny. I've met you twice today.

798
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:22,767
Both times,
you've ended up in my arms.

799
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,121
It's my lucky day.

800
01:03:26,289 --> 01:03:28,757
Lucky day.

801
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:39,208
Did you hear something?

802
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,487
Cornelius.

803
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:48,524
Autowash.

804
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:52,158
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

805
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:58,404
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

806
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,363
Autowash.

807
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:03,201
Coffee's not really my specialty.

808
01:04:04,649 --> 01:04:07,527
But you must drink a lot
of coffee, being a priest.

809
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:16,841
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

810
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:29,162
I'll take the mission.

811
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:46,728
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

812
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:48,447
Good.

813
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:53,839
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

814
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:55,681
"Korben David Dallas." Perfect.

815
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:00,478
I can't be your husband. I'm too old.

816
01:05:00,649 --> 01:05:02,287
Now, David is...

817
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:04,924
...in great shape. He'll protect you.

818
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:09,128
Now, please, go to the diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

819
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:10,608
Now. Yes.

820
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:13,083
Okay.

821
01:05:17,329 --> 01:05:19,843
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry up.

822
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:24,363
The tickets.

823
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:27,123
- ID, please.
- I'm sorry.

824
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,360
- There.
- In here?

825
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:32,764
Mr. Dallas?

826
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:35,278
Yeah.

827
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:37,644
Congratulations
on winning the contest.

828
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,606
Oh, right. Okay.

829
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,361
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

830
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:42,604
The garbage.

831
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:48,602
Made it!

832
01:05:49,089 --> 01:05:51,159
I was so afraid I wouldn't make it...

833
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:54,446
...so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

834
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:57,487
Now David has to go.
Thank you. Bye.

835
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:00,280
I am Korben Dallas.

836
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:03,841
<i>Please report infractions</i>
<i>immediately to the spaceport.</i>

837
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:05,323
And this is?

838
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,519
Leeloo Dallas. Multi-pass.

839
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:10,398
Multi-pass.

840
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:12,207
She knows it's a multi-pass.

841
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:15,247
My wife. We're newlyweds. Just met.

842
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:18,924
Bump into each other,
sparks happen... She knows.

843
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:20,522
Anyway, we're in love.

844
01:06:21,169 --> 01:06:24,684
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

845
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:28,046
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

846
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:34,246
- You want some more?
- Yeah.

847
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:38,598
Make that two.

848
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:42,444
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

849
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:45,477
- What?!
- I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

850
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:48,198
But this is not possible.

851
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:50,168
This is not possible.

852
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:51,603
You want some more?

853
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:53,088
This is all my fault.

854
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:56,359
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

855
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:57,564
I know.

856
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:01,160
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

857
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:04,127
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.

858
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:08,199
I don't want to go to Egypt.

859
01:07:11,889 --> 01:07:13,880
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

860
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:16,998
That's me.

861
01:07:18,169 --> 01:07:20,046
Just a minute, please.

862
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:27,719
It will take just one more minute.

863
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:38,280
We'll be right back.

864
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:44,402
Mr. Dallas, we really need you now.

865
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:47,879
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and he needs you for an interview.

866
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:49,198
Miss?

867
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:50,684
Multi-pass.

868
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,407
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

869
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:00,839
Aliens ahead. Spread out.

870
01:08:10,049 --> 01:08:11,641
Backup unit, zone 18.

871
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:26,200
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honour to be on his talk show.

872
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:28,208
He's so green.

873
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:29,524
I'm sure you're excited.

874
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,566
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

875
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:33,640
I prefer to remain anonymous.

876
01:08:37,089 --> 01:08:38,761
Korben Dallas!

877
01:08:38,929 --> 01:08:42,968
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

878
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:46,360
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

879
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:49,407
...because he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

880
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:55,085
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

881
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:56,443
Right on.

882
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:58,600
And he's got something to say...

883
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:01,078
...to those 50 billion pairs
of ears out there.

884
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:02,638
Pop it, D-man.

885
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,644
Hi.

886
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:09,960
Unbelievable.

887
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:14,928
Quiver, ladies.
He's gonna set the world on fire.

888
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:16,363
Right here from 5 to 7.

889
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:19,965
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

890
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:21,482
His dreams...

891
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:22,923
...his desires...

892
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:25,728
...his most intimate of intimates.

893
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:28,608
And from what I'm looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

894
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:30,521
So tell me, my man...

895
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:32,042
...you nervous in the service?

896
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:36,362
Not really.

897
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:40,524
Freeze those knees because Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

898
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:44,443
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's prince...

899
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:46,759
...of Fhloston Paradise!

900
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:49,967
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

901
01:09:50,129 --> 01:09:52,518
A magic fountain flowing
with non-stop wine, women and...

902
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,361
...hootchie-kootchie-koo...

903
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:56,042
...all night long.

904
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:09,400
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

905
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:12,447
Here, from 5 to 7,
I'll be your voice, your tongue...

906
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:16,682
...on the trail of the sexiest man
of the year: D-man, your man...

907
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:20,044
...my man.

908
01:10:22,369 --> 01:10:23,882
<i>End of transmission.</i>

909
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:25,721
<i>Okay, Ruby.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow at 5.</i>

910
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,687
How was it?

911
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:32,600
It was just absolutely green.

912
01:10:34,009 --> 01:10:35,078
Green like what?

913
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:37,197
Crystal green.

914
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:39,325
Any kind of green you want...

915
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,288
...tree green, emerald, pond green.

916
01:10:53,889 --> 01:10:57,518
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

917
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:01,079
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

918
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:02,648
It must pop, pop, pop!

919
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,208
So tomorrow, from 5 to 7...

920
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:07,520
...please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

921
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,439
It must be green! Okay? Okay?

922
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,647
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

923
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:16,928
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

924
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:19,887
Tomorrow, from 5 to 7,
you'll give yourself a hand.

925
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:22,599
- Green?
- Super-green.

926
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:26,121
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

927
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,483
That's me.

928
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:31,646
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

929
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:38,528
That's impossible. I am Korben Dallas.

930
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:41,317
Sorry, sir. Boarding is finished.

931
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,119
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

932
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:47,081
I need to talk to someone!

933
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,921
I don't believe this!

934
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:53,006
<i>This is not an exercise.</i>
<i>This is a police control.</i>

935
01:11:53,169 --> 01:11:55,239
I'm sorry. I'm calm.

936
01:11:55,889 --> 01:11:57,481
There's been a mistake.

937
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:00,048
To make your flight short...

938
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,206
...flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

939
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:05,208
...which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

940
01:12:09,369 --> 01:12:10,484
Thank you.

941
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:14,724
Hi.

942
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:17,403
- You speak English now.
- Yes. I learn.

943
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:18,684
Good.

944
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:21,201
Leeloo, we are not on vacation.

945
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:24,725
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

946
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:27,767
If I hadn't come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

947
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:30,159
- Understand? Big trouble?
- Yes.

948
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,240
But you, no trouble.

949
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:35,359
Me, fifth element.

950
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,920
Supreme being.

951
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,720
Me protect you.

952
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:45,038
Sleep.

953
01:12:48,009 --> 01:12:49,840
- Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas.
- No, wait...

954
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:56,159
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

955
01:12:56,329 --> 01:12:58,559
Thank you.
Zone two, are you operative?

956
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,403
<i>Zone two?</i>

957
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:02,082
Everything's ready, captain.

958
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:03,762
- Mr. Rhod.
- What?

959
01:13:03,929 --> 01:13:05,885
Assume your individual position.

960
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,846
But I want all positions!

961
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:10,323
Mr. Rhod!

962
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:14,558
- Parasites in landing gear.
- Ground, you copy?

963
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,162
Got it. Front gear.

964
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:18,968
Hey, man, give me some heat, man!

965
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:22,644
We need some heat here, man!
Get some heat!

966
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:25,839
Some heat over here, man!

967
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:29,046
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here, man!

968
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:45,798
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

969
01:13:48,409 --> 01:13:50,559
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

970
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:54,804
Take that.

971
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:57,280
Mr. Rhod!

972
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:00,081
You can call me Ruby.

973
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,201
Fuelled and ready to go.

974
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:06,562
I'll buy you one.

975
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:10,328
Have you taken off already?

976
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:13,967
- I'm not on the plane.
- What?

977
01:14:14,129 --> 01:14:17,360
The real Dallas took my place.
I don't understand.

978
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:18,928
Are you making fun of me?

979
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:21,205
No, no, no! I swear! I swear!

980
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:24,327
I never felt this way before
with a human.

981
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:27,208
- Really?
- Yeah!

982
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:31,204
I've tried everything, believe me.
There's no way to get on the plane.

983
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:41,688
- Ground is clear.
- Roger. Ready for liftoff?

984
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:43,043
Confirmed.

985
01:14:48,169 --> 01:14:51,366
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

986
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,121
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

987
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:59,008
- Protection?
- Confirmed.

988
01:14:59,689 --> 01:15:01,122
Power increase.

989
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,324
Ten seconds.

990
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:03,922
I am...

991
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:05,764
...a little...

992
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:08,565
...disappointed.
- Five...

993
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:12,005
- lf there is one thing I do not like...
- Three...

994
01:15:12,169 --> 01:15:14,478
...it is to be...
...two...

995
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:17,361
...disappointed.
...one...

996
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:20,646
- Sorry, this will never happen again.
- I know.

997
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,838
...liftoff.

998
01:15:32,969 --> 01:15:35,847
- Landing gear secure.
- Roger. Checklist for light speed.

999
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:03,120
Sir, we're finally getting something.

1000
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:05,527
It's sending radio wavelengths.

1001
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:09,524
- What does it want with radio waves?
- Maybe it wants to make a call.

1002
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:15,121
Zorg's office.

1003
01:16:16,169 --> 01:16:18,399
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1004
01:16:18,569 --> 01:16:21,527
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1005
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:23,361
...and it's Mr. Shadow on the line.

1006
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,800
<i>It's Shadow again.</i>

1007
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:36,642
Zorg here.

1008
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:41,360
<i>- Am I disturbing you?</i>
- No, no, I was just...

1009
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:44,803
Where are you?

1010
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:47,599
<i>Not far now.</i>

1011
01:16:49,049 --> 01:16:50,084
Good.

1012
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:52,082
Good, good.

1013
01:16:52,249 --> 01:16:56,447
<i>How are the stones?</i>

1014
01:16:56,609 --> 01:17:00,397
Fine. Fine. Just fine.
I'll have the...

1015
01:17:00,809 --> 01:17:04,085
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1016
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,921
...but it wasn't easy.

1017
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:08,398
My costs have tripled.

1018
01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:14,807
<i>Money is of no importance.</i>

1019
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:21,047
<i>I want the stones.</i>

1020
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:23,006
The stones...

1021
01:17:24,249 --> 01:17:26,399
...will be here.

1022
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:30,081
I'll see to it personally.

1023
01:17:30,249 --> 01:17:33,525
<i>I will be among you...</i>

1024
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,443
<i>... soon.</i>

1025
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,763
- We lost it.
- We lost the signal.

1026
01:17:40,929 --> 01:17:42,647
Damn!

1027
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:02,246
<i>We've begun our descent</i>
<i>toward Fhloston Paradise.</i>

1028
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,320
<i>The local time is 3:20 p.m.</i>

1029
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:08,084
<i>Auto-temperature is currently</i>
<i>85 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

1030
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:12,003
<i>We hope you enjoyed your flight</i>
<i>and hope to</i> see <i>you again soon.</i>

1031
01:18:30,089 --> 01:18:33,126
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to paradise.</i>

1032
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:46,009
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1033
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:21,040
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1034
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:22,881
Again? I'll get it.

1035
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:33,121
Have we arrived yet?

1036
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,929
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1037
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:39,287
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1038
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:42,407
All the restaurants are between
level two and level 10.

1039
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:46,482
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p.m.

1040
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:50,005
Then the airship goes higher
to offer you a better view.

1041
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:52,729
- Is the diva here yet?
- Not yet.

1042
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:57,201
- Any tickets left for the opera?
- You have a seat reserved, front row...

1043
01:19:57,369 --> 01:19:59,360
...next to Ruby Rhod!

1044
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:02,487
He's so talented, don't you think?
I love him. He's so sexy.

1045
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:05,925
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in <i>20</i> minutes.

1046
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,280
Where can I get something to wear?

1047
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:15,242
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1048
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:26,006
<i>You miserable bastard,</i>
<i>I never should've pushed you out.</i>

1049
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:28,967
<i>I was in labour for days,</i>
<i>and this is how you repay me?</i>

1050
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:32,360
<i>- I should've gotten a robot.</i>
- Come on, Ma.

1051
01:20:32,609 --> 01:20:34,042
<i>I should be there, not you.</i>

1052
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,359
<i>I need a tan. I need a cocktail.</i>

1053
01:20:58,129 --> 01:20:59,448
Get the case in.

1054
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:04,881
Hello, Ms. Diva. I'm Fog.

1055
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:08,366
Welcome to the... I'm security.

1056
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:11,647
Welcome to the... Tall...

1057
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:31,404
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1058
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:33,366
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1059
01:21:35,569 --> 01:21:38,641
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you're here.

1060
01:21:38,809 --> 01:21:41,642
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1061
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:42,798
Stay here.

1062
01:21:44,889 --> 01:21:49,804
<i>You're listening to Radio Cosmos</i>
<i>and it is now 5 p.m.</i>

1063
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:52,039
- Helm to 108.
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:54,848
Helm 108!

1065
01:21:55,009 --> 01:21:56,124
Helm to 108.

1066
01:21:56,289 --> 01:22:00,726
<i>Time to join Ruby Rhod</i>
<i>and Korben Dallas...</i>

1067
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:05,087
<i>... the lucky winner</i>
<i>of the Gemini Croquette Contest.</i>

1068
01:22:05,249 --> 01:22:08,161
<i>Coming at you live from Fhloston...</i>

1069
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:09,768
Paradise!

1070
01:22:09,929 --> 01:22:14,559
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1071
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,448
...and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1072
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:19,645
...and 8000 other lucksters here...

1073
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:24,439
...to enjoy the privilege of the
unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1074
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:29,839
Now we enter what must be...

1075
01:22:30,009 --> 01:22:32,569
...the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1076
01:22:32,729 --> 01:22:36,642
A perfect replica
of the old opera house...

1077
01:22:37,129 --> 01:22:38,721
...but who cares?

1078
01:22:38,889 --> 01:22:42,359
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1079
01:22:42,529 --> 01:22:45,919
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1080
01:22:46,089 --> 01:22:48,762
He's not gonna get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1081
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:51,008
To who?

1082
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:54,846
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1083
01:22:55,009 --> 01:22:58,399
The Emperor of Kodar Japhet
and his lovely daughter.

1084
01:22:58,569 --> 01:23:01,606
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1085
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:04,966
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1086
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:09,248
I play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1087
01:23:09,409 --> 01:23:11,718
...for Korben
to say the word of the day.

1088
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:15,964
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1089
01:23:17,889 --> 01:23:19,686
Thrilled.

1090
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:23,482
And now champagne!

1091
01:23:29,289 --> 01:23:31,519
Commercial!
Commercial!

1092
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:33,282
<i>Break for 30 seconds.</i>

1093
01:23:49,249 --> 01:23:50,523
Showtime.

1094
01:25:38,209 --> 01:25:41,724
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1095
01:25:41,889 --> 01:25:44,608
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1096
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:47,808
<i>- Permission granted for one hour.</i>
- More than I need.

1097
01:26:01,009 --> 01:26:04,285
- Yes?
- Champagne for the diva.

1098
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:06,042
I'll take it.

1099
01:26:38,929 --> 01:26:40,726
I found it.

1100
01:27:14,209 --> 01:27:15,244
Get her!

1101
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,928
It was an ambush.

1102
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:54,442
If it's war they want,
it's war they'll get!

1103
01:28:57,369 --> 01:28:59,087
Bravo! Bravo!

1104
01:28:59,249 --> 01:29:01,319
Bravo! Bravo!

1105
01:29:01,489 --> 01:29:03,002
My compliments, little lady.

1106
01:29:03,169 --> 01:29:07,481
Thank you for doing all the dirty work.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.

1107
01:29:08,089 --> 01:29:09,204
Hand over the stones.

1108
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,165
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1109
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:56,127
Hands up!

1110
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:12,039
Ruby! Ruby!

1111
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,968
I know this music.

1112
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,245
Let's change the beat.

1113
01:31:13,329 --> 01:31:15,524
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we're being attacked.

1114
01:31:15,689 --> 01:31:17,884
<i>I don't know who they are,</i>
<i>but they're everywhere.</i>

1115
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:20,085
<i>I see one. They're warriors,</i>
<i>and they're ugly.</i>

1116
01:31:20,249 --> 01:31:23,286
<i>They got big teeth, big foreheads,</i>
<i>and they stink.</i>

1117
01:31:23,409 --> 01:31:24,398
Mangalores.

1118
01:31:27,089 --> 01:31:29,444
The government sent me to help you.
Stay calm.

1119
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:33,522
If somebody hears this,
come and get me. I'm in the first row.

1120
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:38,089
- You must give her the stones.
- Who?

1121
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:39,847
The fifth element.

1122
01:31:40,169 --> 01:31:44,128
The supreme being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1123
01:31:44,289 --> 01:31:46,803
- Leeloo?
- Yes.

1124
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:50,886
But she's more fragile than she seems.

1125
01:31:51,369 --> 01:31:53,360
She needs your help...

1126
01:31:54,089 --> 01:31:55,920
...and your love...

1127
01:31:56,089 --> 01:31:59,525
...or she will die.

1128
01:32:03,369 --> 01:32:05,929
- Stay with me.
- Help!

1129
01:32:12,889 --> 01:32:16,882
If you want something done,
do it yourself.

1130
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:20,885
Come on, honey. You can't die.
Listen to me. Wake up!

1131
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:22,562
- Where are the stones?
- What?

1132
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:25,038
The stones. Where are the stones?

1133
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:26,358
The stones.

1134
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:41,361
They're not here.

1135
01:32:42,169 --> 01:32:44,285
The stones, where are they?

1136
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,202
In me.

1137
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:48,848
What?

1138
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:58,406
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.

1139
01:32:58,569 --> 01:33:01,083
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1140
01:33:01,249 --> 01:33:02,967
Hey, you!

1141
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:05,087
I said you.

1142
01:33:05,249 --> 01:33:06,967
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

1143
01:33:09,849 --> 01:33:12,966
I said one minute.
Ruby, hold this gun.

1144
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,528
What do you want me to do?

1145
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,123
Come on. Put your hand on it.

1146
01:33:17,289 --> 01:33:19,519
- What do I do?
- Lf he moves, squeeze the trigger.

1147
01:33:21,249 --> 01:33:25,367
- I don't feel right. I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1148
01:33:34,569 --> 01:33:36,799
I got a headache. This ain't me.

1149
01:33:54,569 --> 01:33:55,684
Sorry.

1150
01:33:56,969 --> 01:33:58,004
Think he'll be okay?

1151
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:07,598
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1152
01:34:10,009 --> 01:34:11,840
Shit. Three coming.

1153
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:18,720
You guard this with your life,
or you'll look like him. You green?

1154
01:34:18,889 --> 01:34:21,198
- Green.
- <i>Super- green?</i>

1155
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:23,678
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1156
01:34:23,849 --> 01:34:27,478
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1157
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:55,202
Move! Move!

1158
01:34:56,249 --> 01:34:58,240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1159
01:34:58,409 --> 01:35:01,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is amazing.

1160
01:35:03,049 --> 01:35:04,562
Let me do it.

1161
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,680
Oh, my God. Korben Dallas,
my man, is in trouble.

1162
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:22,238
The gun!

1163
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,840
The gun! Give me the gun.

1164
01:35:26,009 --> 01:35:31,288
I'm gonna go and try to see
if I can see something a little closer.

1165
01:35:47,289 --> 01:35:48,961
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1166
01:35:57,809 --> 01:35:58,844
Thanks, Ray.

1167
01:35:59,769 --> 01:36:03,239
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1168
01:36:03,409 --> 01:36:04,398
Get up!

1169
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:06,878
You've got the wrong guy! Don't shoot!

1170
01:36:07,049 --> 01:36:08,323
I'm not armed!

1171
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:12,798
Oh, my God.

1172
01:36:12,969 --> 01:36:14,527
I'm on vacation.

1173
01:36:14,849 --> 01:36:18,398
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation. I won a...

1174
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:20,804
...contest.

1175
01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:24,405
Gemini Croquette's to
Fhloston Paradise.

1176
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:28,481
Down.

1177
01:36:29,849 --> 01:36:31,805
- Wait a minute.
- Get down!

1178
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:36,443
- He's trying to say something to me.
- Down!

1179
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:51,523
Sorry, my man.

1180
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:01,758
Where are you?

1181
01:37:03,049 --> 01:37:05,279
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1182
01:37:05,769 --> 01:37:07,839
They're coming. They're coming.

1183
01:37:11,729 --> 01:37:12,718
Don't move.

1184
01:37:23,449 --> 01:37:26,247
- What you doing?
- Count to 10.

1185
01:37:34,049 --> 01:37:35,880
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1186
01:37:36,049 --> 01:37:38,961
One, two, three, four, five...

1187
01:37:39,129 --> 01:37:41,279
...six, seven, eight...

1188
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:43,682
...nine...

1189
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:08,083
Ten.

1190
01:38:13,849 --> 01:38:17,524
I am very disappointed!

1191
01:38:18,169 --> 01:38:20,239
Korben, what are you looking for?

1192
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:21,558
Control room.

1193
01:38:23,289 --> 01:38:24,881
- This is it.
- I'll be over here.

1194
01:38:25,049 --> 01:38:26,368
Let's go!

1195
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:31,202
Quiet! Quiet!

1196
01:38:32,649 --> 01:38:33,923
You in charge?

1197
01:38:35,049 --> 01:38:36,482
How many are out there?

1198
01:38:37,529 --> 01:38:39,121
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1199
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,480
Seven on the left. Five on the right.

1200
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:52,560
Four on the right. Two on the left.

1201
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:56,482
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1202
01:38:56,969 --> 01:38:59,278
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1203
01:39:00,329 --> 01:39:03,366
- That's the leader.
- Send someone to negotiate.

1204
01:39:05,369 --> 01:39:07,678
I've never negotiated.

1205
01:39:07,929 --> 01:39:09,760
You mind if I try?

1206
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:11,601
No, no. Sure, sure.

1207
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:14,158
We're sending somebody in
to negotiate!

1208
01:39:22,689 --> 01:39:24,645
Anybody else want to negotiate?

1209
01:39:24,849 --> 01:39:27,443
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1210
01:39:27,929 --> 01:39:29,203
I wonder.

1211
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:34,843
Where's Ruby?

1212
01:39:35,769 --> 01:39:37,168
I thought he was dead.

1213
01:39:37,329 --> 01:39:38,318
Master!

1214
01:39:38,969 --> 01:39:41,529
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1215
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:44,318
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1216
01:39:44,489 --> 01:39:45,842
...still alive.

1217
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:49,129
What's wrong with you? It hurt!

1218
01:39:54,809 --> 01:39:58,484
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1219
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:00,958
...but I'm fighting for a noble cause.

1220
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:03,848
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1221
01:40:04,329 --> 01:40:07,401
- Right now, I'm trying to save Leeloo.
- Leeloo's in trouble?

1222
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:09,082
When is Leeloo not in trouble?

1223
01:40:09,249 --> 01:40:11,524
- There. Where's that?
- The diva's suite.

1224
01:40:16,729 --> 01:40:17,764
Hang on.

1225
01:40:21,009 --> 01:40:24,160
Here, come on. How do you
get yourself into these positions?

1226
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:26,483
Come on.

1227
01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:32,487
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1228
01:40:32,889 --> 01:40:33,924
Listen.

1229
01:40:36,409 --> 01:40:39,287
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1230
01:40:41,849 --> 01:40:45,603
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1231
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:52,801
It's... It's...

1232
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:56,801
If it was a bomb...

1233
01:40:56,969 --> 01:41:01,042
...the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1234
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:04,845
<i>This is a Type A alert.</i>

1235
01:41:05,009 --> 01:41:08,558
<i>For security reasons,</i>
<i>the hotel must be evacuated.</i>

1236
01:41:09,769 --> 01:41:11,361
<i>Proceed calmly to the lifeboats...</i>

1237
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:12,882
Stay calm!

1238
01:41:13,049 --> 01:41:14,528
<i>... located in the main hallways.</i>

1239
01:41:14,689 --> 01:41:15,838
Please, stay calm!

1240
01:41:21,289 --> 01:41:23,849
Korben, my man,
you know how to stop this, right?

1241
01:41:29,289 --> 01:41:32,486
<i>Two minutes to complete evacuation.</i>

1242
01:41:34,409 --> 01:41:37,128
- Get back!
- Evacuation! Evacuation!

1243
01:41:37,289 --> 01:41:40,486
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1244
01:41:45,209 --> 01:41:46,324
I know.

1245
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:03,362
- I don't want to die.
- Please, my son.

1246
01:42:03,969 --> 01:42:05,243
Get in.

1247
01:42:09,889 --> 01:42:12,528
<i>One minute to total evacuation.</i>

1248
01:42:16,809 --> 01:42:18,037
This one.

1249
01:42:21,329 --> 01:42:23,081
<i>Forty-five seconds.</i>

1250
01:42:26,209 --> 01:42:27,722
Get her strapped in.

1251
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:35,168
Korben, my man,
you know how to fly this thing?

1252
01:42:35,329 --> 01:42:36,557
Just like driving a cab.

1253
01:42:41,009 --> 01:42:42,840
How we gonna get out the door?

1254
01:42:55,809 --> 01:42:57,561
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

1255
01:43:02,129 --> 01:43:05,565
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

1256
01:43:05,729 --> 01:43:09,961
<i>... seven, six, five...</i>

1257
01:43:26,049 --> 01:43:27,880
For the honour.

1258
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:32,764
Oh, no.

1259
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:34,598
You should hold on.

1260
01:43:56,049 --> 01:43:57,243
Like driving a cab.

1261
01:43:59,169 --> 01:44:01,729
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now 7 p.m. Time for the news.

1262
01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:03,720
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1263
01:44:04,129 --> 01:44:05,721
<i>End of transmission.</i>

1264
01:44:06,609 --> 01:44:08,520
That's the best show I ever did.

1265
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:13,968
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1266
01:44:14,129 --> 01:44:16,768
...and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1267
01:44:21,169 --> 01:44:22,443
We're saved.

1268
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:40,529
The diva said
I should take care of you.

1269
01:44:41,569 --> 01:44:44,037
Humans act so strange.

1270
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:45,324
What do you mean?

1271
01:44:46,929 --> 01:44:48,885
Everything you created...

1272
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:50,607
...is used to destroy.

1273
01:44:52,769 --> 01:44:56,284
We call it human nature.
You learn that on your screen?

1274
01:44:56,449 --> 01:44:59,168
I'm not finished yet. I'm up to V.

1275
01:44:59,969 --> 01:45:01,243
V is good.

1276
01:45:01,649 --> 01:45:03,446
Some very good words in V.

1277
01:45:03,609 --> 01:45:04,837
Like what?

1278
01:45:07,089 --> 01:45:08,363
Valiant.

1279
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:10,123
Vulnerable.

1280
01:45:12,449 --> 01:45:14,041
Very beautiful.

1281
01:45:25,329 --> 01:45:27,718
Oh, of course, Munro!

1282
01:45:29,009 --> 01:45:31,398
- Mr. President?
- Yes, now what?

1283
01:45:34,609 --> 01:45:35,962
We have a problem.

1284
01:45:41,249 --> 01:45:42,523
It's advancing?

1285
01:45:42,689 --> 01:45:46,125
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1286
01:45:50,449 --> 01:45:53,646
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1287
01:46:00,209 --> 01:46:03,007
Korben, there's a general on the phone.

1288
01:46:03,809 --> 01:46:05,845
I'll give you the president.

1289
01:46:06,529 --> 01:46:09,327
Major Dallas, I first would like
to salute a warrior.

1290
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,798
<i>You're a shining example of this army.</i>

1291
01:46:11,969 --> 01:46:13,766
<i>In the name of the Federation...</i>

1292
01:46:13,929 --> 01:46:15,726
Any idea when you'll get to the point?

1293
01:46:17,889 --> 01:46:22,599
Okay. There's a ball of fire 1 200 miles
in diameter heading straight for Earth...

1294
01:46:22,769 --> 01:46:25,966
<i>... and we have no idea how to stop it.</i>
<i>That's the problem.</i>

1295
01:46:29,169 --> 01:46:30,602
How much time do we have?

1296
01:46:31,569 --> 01:46:34,925
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1297
01:46:35,969 --> 01:46:37,880
I'll call you back in two hours.

1298
01:46:38,049 --> 01:46:39,164
Hello?

1299
01:47:47,929 --> 01:47:49,806
They just landed in the desert.

1300
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:53,601
Good job, David.

1301
01:47:55,209 --> 01:47:57,359
- Put her in the centre.
- Where? Here?

1302
01:48:04,809 --> 01:48:06,481
You got it figured out, Father?

1303
01:48:06,649 --> 01:48:09,117
This one should be fire.

1304
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:11,439
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1305
01:48:11,609 --> 01:48:14,601
The four stones should go around.

1306
01:48:14,769 --> 01:48:16,760
The fifth element should be
in the middle...

1307
01:48:16,929 --> 01:48:19,602
...and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1308
01:48:20,249 --> 01:48:22,240
- You've never seen this work?
- No.

1309
01:48:23,609 --> 01:48:26,885
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1310
01:48:34,889 --> 01:48:37,562
- That's it. That's it.
- Match up the symbols. Go! Go!

1311
01:48:39,129 --> 01:48:40,164
Wind.

1312
01:48:41,929 --> 01:48:43,885
My man, what you doing?

1313
01:48:44,049 --> 01:48:45,926
- What?
- What you doing?

1314
01:48:47,049 --> 01:48:48,801
Trying to keep you in the DJ business.

1315
01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:53,364
Fire.

1316
01:48:54,769 --> 01:48:55,838
Done.

1317
01:48:56,009 --> 01:48:59,684
- So, what happens now?
- So now, we have to open them.

1318
01:49:00,769 --> 01:49:04,000
- And you know how to do that, right?
- Theoretically...

1319
01:49:05,689 --> 01:49:06,724
...no.

1320
01:49:11,369 --> 01:49:14,327
Leeloo, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.

1321
01:49:15,049 --> 01:49:16,880
How do you open these stones?

1322
01:49:18,089 --> 01:49:19,920
Wind blows.

1323
01:49:21,369 --> 01:49:22,882
Fire burns.

1324
01:49:23,049 --> 01:49:26,246
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1325
01:49:26,569 --> 01:49:27,763
Rain...

1326
01:49:31,049 --> 01:49:32,402
...falls.

1327
01:49:38,689 --> 01:49:39,963
What does it mean?

1328
01:49:41,689 --> 01:49:42,963
I think that...

1329
01:49:43,129 --> 01:49:45,848
Maybe it's a charade.
A game or something.

1330
01:49:46,249 --> 01:49:48,558
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1331
01:49:48,729 --> 01:49:50,321
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1332
01:50:02,409 --> 01:50:03,683
Too late.

1333
01:50:05,369 --> 01:50:08,406
- We've lost contact with them.
- Three minutes.

1334
01:50:09,849 --> 01:50:12,727
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?

1335
01:50:20,889 --> 01:50:22,481
We're never gonna make it.

1336
01:50:27,249 --> 01:50:29,683
Korben. Korben, it moved!

1337
01:50:31,089 --> 01:50:33,205
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1338
01:50:33,369 --> 01:50:34,802
Shut up, shut up!

1339
01:50:34,969 --> 01:50:37,802
Calm down. Show me
what you did, step by step.

1340
01:50:37,969 --> 01:50:40,119
- I was just standing here.
- Quickly.

1341
01:50:40,289 --> 01:50:44,407
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said:

1342
01:50:45,289 --> 01:50:47,166
"We're not gonna make it."

1343
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:49,923
And that's it?

1344
01:50:58,329 --> 01:50:59,603
Korben, my man.

1345
01:51:00,249 --> 01:51:01,648
Wind.

1346
01:51:02,089 --> 01:51:04,239
She said, "Wind blows."

1347
01:51:11,849 --> 01:51:13,282
Everyone take a stone.

1348
01:51:13,609 --> 01:51:16,407
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1349
01:51:18,729 --> 01:51:19,844
Earth.

1350
01:51:20,089 --> 01:51:21,522
Open the other one.

1351
01:51:36,729 --> 01:51:39,038
Korben, my man, I have no fire.

1352
01:51:39,209 --> 01:51:41,279
I have no matches. Do you have any?

1353
01:51:41,449 --> 01:51:43,758
I stopped smoking. Father, you smoke?

1354
01:51:43,929 --> 01:51:46,489
Got some matches? We need some fire.

1355
01:51:47,729 --> 01:51:49,367
We gonna die.

1356
01:51:56,329 --> 01:51:57,682
Don't breathe.

1357
01:52:16,169 --> 01:52:17,204
Fire.

1358
01:52:17,929 --> 01:52:18,918
One minute.

1359
01:52:19,089 --> 01:52:20,602
Let's go, Leeloo.

1360
01:52:20,769 --> 01:52:23,681
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1361
01:52:24,409 --> 01:52:25,842
Protect life...

1362
01:52:27,049 --> 01:52:28,243
...until death.

1363
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:31,128
Listen to me! Listen to me.

1364
01:52:31,289 --> 01:52:33,849
Listen, I know you're very tired.

1365
01:52:34,009 --> 01:52:37,604
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1366
01:52:37,849 --> 01:52:41,046
But if you don't do something
right now, we'll all die.

1367
01:52:41,209 --> 01:52:44,724
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1368
01:52:45,049 --> 01:52:47,609
Lt'll be entering the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1369
01:52:48,969 --> 01:52:50,482
Leeloo, you're right. You're right.

1370
01:52:50,649 --> 01:52:52,401
But there are some things...

1371
01:52:52,569 --> 01:52:55,129
...very nice things worth saving,
beautiful things.

1372
01:52:55,529 --> 01:52:57,281
Beautiful things.

1373
01:52:58,329 --> 01:52:59,728
Like love?

1374
01:52:59,889 --> 01:53:01,800
Yes, love. That's good. That's good.

1375
01:53:01,969 --> 01:53:04,244
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.

1376
01:53:05,129 --> 01:53:06,847
I don't know love.

1377
01:53:08,809 --> 01:53:10,037
I don't know love.

1378
01:53:10,209 --> 01:53:12,439
I was built to protect, not to love.

1379
01:53:12,649 --> 01:53:15,322
So there's no use
for me other than this.

1380
01:53:15,489 --> 01:53:17,798
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1381
01:53:18,489 --> 01:53:21,401
I need you. I need you, very much.

1382
01:53:23,049 --> 01:53:24,164
Why?

1383
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:27,323
Because...

1384
01:53:27,649 --> 01:53:28,968
Because...

1385
01:53:29,849 --> 01:53:31,805
Tell her, Korben.

1386
01:53:33,569 --> 01:53:36,083
Tell me. Please.

1387
01:53:36,249 --> 01:53:38,080
Why do you need me?

1388
01:53:38,569 --> 01:53:41,561
- Because...
- Tell me.

1389
01:53:43,609 --> 01:53:45,008
- Tell me.
- Because l...

1390
01:53:45,249 --> 01:53:46,682
Because I love you.

1391
01:53:47,849 --> 01:53:49,123
I love you.

1392
01:53:52,849 --> 01:53:56,967
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1393
01:53:57,409 --> 01:54:00,765
...six, five, four, three...

1394
01:54:01,129 --> 01:54:03,359
...two, one...

1395
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:43,842
<i>Scanner imaging has confirmed</i>
<i>the dark planet dead.</i>

1396
01:54:44,489 --> 01:54:47,162
The planet seems to have stopped
at <i>62</i> miles from impact.

1397
01:54:59,489 --> 01:55:01,764
What's wrong with you?
What you screaming for?

1398
01:55:01,929 --> 01:55:04,159
Every five minutes,
it's a bomb or something.

1399
01:55:04,329 --> 01:55:05,603
I'm leaving.

1400
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:20,837
Mr. President.

1401
01:55:21,009 --> 01:55:23,603
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the centre.

1402
01:55:23,769 --> 01:55:25,487
It's an honour, Mr. President.

1403
01:55:25,649 --> 01:55:27,241
Where are my two heroes?

1404
01:55:27,409 --> 01:55:31,038
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1405
01:55:31,209 --> 01:55:33,040
I have 19 meetings after this.

1406
01:55:33,209 --> 01:55:35,518
Let me see if they're revived.

1407
01:55:35,689 --> 01:55:36,724
Thank you.

1408
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:39,199
We go live in one minute,
Mr. President.

1409
01:55:46,969 --> 01:55:48,448
They're...

1410
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:51,406
...not ready.

1411
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:52,797
They need...

1412
01:55:52,969 --> 01:55:55,608
...five more minutes.
- You have <i>20</i> seconds.

1413
01:55:55,769 --> 01:55:58,966
- No, ma'am, I tried. No, ma'am.
- Who's that?

1414
01:55:59,129 --> 01:56:00,721
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

1415
01:56:00,889 --> 01:56:02,004
Give it here.

1416
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:07,600
Mrs. Dallas, this is the president.
On behalf of the Federation...

1417
01:56:07,769 --> 01:56:09,521
<i>That doesn't even sound lik</i> e <i>him.</i>

1418
01:56:09,689 --> 01:56:11,919
<i>The president's an idiot.</i>
<i>You don't sound lik</i> e <i>an idiot.</i>

1419
01:56:12,089 --> 01:56:15,206
<i>If you don't want to talk to your mother,</i>
<i>just av oid me as usual.</i>

1420
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:18,884
<i>I'll throw myself in traffic.</i>
<i>I'll Saran Wrap myself to the bed.</i>

1421
