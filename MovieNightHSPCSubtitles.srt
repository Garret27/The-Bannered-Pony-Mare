142

to take you on a strange journey.

143
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,480
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...

144
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,402
when Brad Majors and
his fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss...

145
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:01,613
two young, ordinary, healthy kids...

146
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:05,534
left Denton that
late November evening...

147
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:09,538
to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...

148
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:13,166
ex-tutor and now friend to both of them.

149
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:20,382
It's true there were
dark storm clouds...

150
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:24,094
heavy, black and pendulous...

151
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,805
toward which they were driving.

152
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,183
It's true also that the spare tire
they carried...

153
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,477
was badly in need of some air.

154
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:36,231
But they, being normal kids and...

155
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:37,983
on a night out...

156
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:42,863
they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.

157
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,034
On a night out.

158
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,621
It was a night out...

159
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,914
they were going to remember...

160
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:56,418
for a very long time.

161
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:08,305

162
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:13,226
<i>To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent...</i>

163
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,604

164
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,523
<i>But as president...</i>

165
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:22,903
<i>I must put the interests
of America first.</i>

166
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:28,033
<i>America needs a full-time president...</i>

167
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,827
<i>and a full-time Congress...</i>

168
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,287
<i>particularly at this time...</i>

169
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:37,542
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.

170
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:41,088
They sure do take their lives
in their hands.

171
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:44,967
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap
to that type.

172
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:53,767
What's the matter, Brad, darling?

173
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:58,146
We took the wrong fork a few miles back.

174
00:12:58,355 --> 00:12:59,189
Oh.

175
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:01,650
Where did that motorcyclist come from?

176
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,946
I guess we'll just have to turn back.

177
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,369
What was that bang?

178
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,413
We must have a blowout.

179
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,959
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten
that spare tire fixed.

180
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,129
You stay here and I'll go for help.

181
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,548
We're in the middle of nowhere.

182
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:32,014
Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?

183
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,518
Maybe they have a telephone I could use.

184
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:37,811
I'm going too.

185
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,983
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.

186
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:48,614
Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman...

187
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,116
and you might never come back again.

188
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:36,828
<i>In the velvet darkness</i>

189
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,331
<i>Of the blackest night</i>

190
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:42,417
<i>Burning bright</i>

191
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:46,797
<i>There's a guiding star</i>

192
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:52,469
<i>No matter what</i>

193
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,721
<i>Or...</i>

194
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,684
<i>who you are</i>

195
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,314
<i>There's a light</i>

196
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:09,653
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

197
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:12,823
<i>There's a light</i>

198
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:20,372
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

199
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:26,128
<i>There's a light, light</i>

200
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,090
<i>In the darkness</i>

201
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:35,178
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

202
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,151
<i>The darkness must go</i>

203
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,070
<i>Down the river</i>

204
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,033
<i>Of nights dreaming</i>

205
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,454
<i>Flow morphia slow</i>

206
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:02,956
<i>Let the sun</i>

207
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:06,084
<i>And light come streaming</i>

208
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,588
<i>Into my life</i>

209
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,844
<i>Into my life</i>

210
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:23,769
<i>There's a light</i>

211
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:28,398
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

212
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,902
<i>There's a light</i>

213
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:39,409
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

214
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,496
<i>There's a light</i>

215
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:45,248
<i>Light</i>

216
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:49,670
<i>In the darkness</i>

217
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,050
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

218
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,475
And so...

219
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:08,438
it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...

220
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,193
and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.

221
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,696
Or had they?

222
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:21,118
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.

223
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,829
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.

224
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,683
Hello.

225
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,688
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.

226
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:53,358
This is my fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss.

227
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,863
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.

228
00:17:58,113 --> 00:17:59,948
Do you have a phone we might use?

229
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,076
You're wet.

230
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,831
Yes, it's raining.

231
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:09,916
Yes.

232
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,628
Oh.

233
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:21,595
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.

234
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,225
You're too kind.

235
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:45,160
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?

236
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,539
It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

237
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:56,421
This way.

238
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,929
Are you having a party?

239
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,558
You've arrived on
a rather special night.

240
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,312
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.

241
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,398
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.

242
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:19,569
He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky!

243
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,877
<i>It's astounding</i>

244
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,755
<i>Time is fleeting</i>

245
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:42,801
<i>Madness takes its toll</i>

246
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,680
<i>But listen closely</i>

247
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:50,017
<i>Not for very much longer</i>

248
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:55,022
<i>I've got to keep control</i>

249
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:57,941
<i>I remember</i>

250
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:00,861
<i>Doing the time warp</i>

251
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,946
<i>Drinking</i>

252
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:05,699
<i>Those moments when</i>

253
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:08,368
<i>The blackness would hit me</i>

254
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,288
<i>And the void would be calling</i>

255
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:16,251
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

256
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:21,173
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

257
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,595
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

258
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:32,267
- <i>And a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

259
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:36,229
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

260
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,815
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

261
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,735
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

262
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:47,157
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

263
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,454
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

264
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,123
<i>It's so dreamy</i>

265
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:58,418
<i>Oh, fantasy free me</i>

266
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,420
<i>So you can't see me</i>

267
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:03,131
<i>No, not at all</i>

268
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,968
<i>In another dimension</i>

269
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:08,845
<i>With voyeuristic intention</i>

270
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:11,765
<i>Well secluded</i>

271
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,017
<i>I see all</i>

272
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,645
<i>With a bit of a mind flip</i>

273
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:19,690
<i>You're into the time slip</i>

274
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,486
<i>And nothing can ever be the same</i>

275
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,322
<i>You're spaced out on sensation</i>

276
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:30,534
<i>Like you're under sedation</i>

277
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:35,330
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

278
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:40,752
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

279
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,089
<i>I was walking down the street
Just having a think</i>

280
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:46,967
<i>When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink</i>

281
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,303
<i>He shook a me up
He took me by surprise</i>

282
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:52,389
<i>He had a pickup truck
And the devil's eyes</i>

283
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:54,975
<i>He stared at me
And I felt a change</i>

284
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,394
<i>Time meant nothing
Never would again</i>

285
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:01,940
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

286
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:07,362
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

287
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:09,156
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

288
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:14,911
- <i>And then a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

289
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:18,915
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

290
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,668
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

291
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:24,546
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

292
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:29,343
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

293
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:35,390
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

294
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:57,829
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

295
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:03,293
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

296
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:04,836
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

297
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:10,634
- <i>And then a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

298
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:14,179
<i>Bring your knees in tight</i>

299
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,848
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

300
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:19,935
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

301
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:25,440
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

302
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:30,946
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

303
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,626
Say something.

304
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:49,881
Say! Do any of you guys know
how to Madison?

305
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:59,057
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.

306
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:02,769
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.

307
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,732
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.

308
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,610
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.

309
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:12,154
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.

310
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:14,448
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.

311
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:17,409
They're probably foreigners
with different ways.

312
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,370
They may do some more folk dancing.

313
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

314
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,211
I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.

315
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:35,093
<i>How do you do</i>

316
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,429
<i>I see you've met</i>

317
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,682
<i>My faithful handyman</i>

318
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:43,268
<i>He's just a little brought down</i>

319
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:46,563
<i>Because when you knocked</i>

320
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,691
<i>He thought you were the candyman</i>

321
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,278
<i>Don't get strung out</i>

322
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,530
<i>By the way I look</i>

323
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,201
<i>Don't judge a book by its cover</i>

324
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,703
<i>I'm not much of a man</i>

325
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:03,705
<i>By the light of day</i>

326
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:07,834
<i>But by night I'm one hell of a lover</i>

327
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:11,588
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

328
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,009
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

329
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,262
<i>Transylvania</i>

330
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,725
<i>Let me show you around</i>

331
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,812
<i>Maybe play you a sound</i>

332
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:30,565
<i>You look like you're both
Pretty groovy</i>

333
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:33,527
<i>Or if you want something visual</i>

334
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:35,988
<i>That's not too abysmal</i>

335
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:39,533
<i>We could take in an old
Steve Reeves movie</i>

336
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:43,287
<i>I'm glad we caught you at home</i>

337
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,998
<i>Could we use your phone?</i>

338
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,959
- <i>We're both in a bit of a hurry</i>
- <i>Right</i>

339
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,003
<i>We'll just say where we are</i>

340
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:54,589
- <i>Then go back to the car</i>
- <i>A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter</i>

341
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,050
<i>We don't want to be any worry</i>

342
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,221
<i>Well, you got caught with a flat</i>

343
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,140
<i>Well, how about that</i>

344
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,852
<i>Well, babies, don't you panic</i>

345
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:09,396
<i>By the light of the night</i>

346
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:11,648
<i>It'll all seem all right</i>

347
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:15,736
<i>I'll get you a satanic mechanic</i>

348
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:19,156
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

349
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,744
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

350
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:27,497
<i>Transylvania</i>

351
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,627
<i>Why don't you stay for the night</i>

352
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:34,171
- <i>Night</i>
- <i>Or maybe a bite</i>

353
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:35,255
<i>Bite</i>

354
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:38,717
<i>I could show you
My favorite obsession</i>

355
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:42,095
<i>I've been making a man</i>

356
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:44,723
<i>With blond hair and a tan</i>

357
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:48,185
<i>And he's good for relieving
My tension</i>

358
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:51,897
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

359
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:56,526
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

360
00:26:56,777 --> 00:27:00,030
<i>Transylvania</i>

361
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:01,907
Hit it! Hit it!

362
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:06,954
- <i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>
- <i>Sweet transvestite</i>

363
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:10,248
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

364
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:12,584
<i>Transylvania</i>

365
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,883
<i>So come up to the lab</i>

366
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,720
<i>And see what's on the slab</i>

367
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,973
<i>I see you shiver</i>

368
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,350
<i>With antici...</i>

369
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,311
<i>pation</i>

370
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:34,523
<i>But maybe the rain</i>

371
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:37,567
<i>Is really to blame</i>

372
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,071
<i>So I'll remove the cause</i>

373
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,910
<i>But not the symptom</i>

374
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:01,508
Thank you.

375
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,763
Thank you very much.

376
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:10,726
Brad!

377
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:15,314
We'll play along for now and pull out
the aces when the time is right.

378
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:20,402
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.

379
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,741
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss.

380
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:30,662
You are...?

381
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:34,291
You are very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.

382
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:38,170
Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.

383
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,547
People like you, maybe?

384
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:42,841
I've seen it.

385
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:50,766
Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.

386
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:53,268
Shift it!

387
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:11,828
Is he...? Frank, I mean,
is he your husband?

388
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:16,416
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.

389
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,252
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.

390
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:05,215
Magenta.

391
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:07,926
Columbia.

392
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:10,846
Go and assist Riff Raff.

393
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:14,391
I will entertain...

394
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:22,649
Brad Majors and this is
my fiancÃ©e, Janet Vice.

395
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,027
- Weiss.
- Weiss?

396
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:29,615
<i>EnchantÃ©.</i>

397
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:32,534
Well, how nice.

398
00:30:32,826 --> 00:30:35,704
And what charming underclothes
you both have.

399
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:39,458
But here, put these on.

400
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:43,211
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.

401
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:46,965
It's not often we receive visitors here.

402
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,968
Let alone offer them hospitality.

403
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:54,848
Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!

404
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,392
A reasonable request you have ignored!

405
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:00,896
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

406
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:04,066
How forceful you are, Brad.

407
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:08,695
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.

408
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:15,702
You must be awfully proud of him, Janet.

409
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,622
Well, yes, I am.

410
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:22,793
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.

411
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:26,129
Oh, well. How about you?

412
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:28,632
Everything is in readiness, master.

413
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:31,969
We merely await your word.

414
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:44,606
Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists...

415
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:48,026
you are to witness a new breakthrough...

416
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:51,405
in biochemical research.

417
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:55,826
And paradise is to be mine!

418
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,833
It was strange the way it happened.

419
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,127
Suddenly...

420
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:07,421
you get a break.

421
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,217
All the pieces seem to fit into place.

422
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:16,388
What a sucker you've been. What a fool.

423
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,349
The answer was there all the time.

424
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,104
It took a small accident
to make it happen.

425
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:27,691
- An accident!
- An accident!

426
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,485
That's how I discovered the secret.

427
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:34,072
That elusive ingredient.

428
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:36,783
That spark...

429
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:40,078
that is the breath of life.

430
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:44,041
Yes.

431
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:49,046
I have that knowledge.

432
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,424
I hold the secret...

433
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:55,719
to life itself!

434
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:12,361
You see...

435
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,197
you are fortunate.

436
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:18,492
For tonight is the night...

437
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:23,872
that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.

438
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:06,206
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.

439
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:14,548
And step up the reactor power input...

440
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:17,509
three more points!

441
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,283
Oh, Brad!

442
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,327
It's all right, Janet.

443
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,936
Oh, Rocky!

444
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:43,238
<i>The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head</i>

445
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:48,035
<i>I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

446
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,707
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

447
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,877
<i>My life is a misery</i>

448
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,338
<i>Oh, can't you see</i>

449
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:02,549
<i>That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

450
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:09,056
<i>I woke up this morning with a start
When I fell out of bed</i>

451
00:37:09,306 --> 00:37:11,433
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

452
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:15,187
<i>And left from my dreaming
Was a feeling of unnameable dread</i>

453
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,689
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

454
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,567
<i>My high is low</i>

455
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:23,695
<i>I'm dressed up with no place to go</i>

456
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:26,615
<i>And all I know</i>

457
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:30,994
<i>Is I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

458
00:37:33,705 --> 00:37:36,166
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

459
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:39,169
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

460
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:42,047
Oh, my baby!

461
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:48,303
<i>The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head</i>

462
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:50,806
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

463
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:54,393
<i>I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

464
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,187
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

465
00:37:57,437 --> 00:38:00,232
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

466
00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:02,818
<i>My life is a mystery</i>

467
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,821
<i>And can't you see</i>

468
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:09,408
<i>That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

469
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:15,414
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

470
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,458
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

471
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:38,395
Well, really!

472
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,316
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.

473
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:50,657
But since you're such
an exceptional beauty...

474
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:53,368
I'm prepared to forgive you.

475
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:00,792
Oh, I just love success!

476
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:03,420
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.

477
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,672
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.

478
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,299
He's okay.

479
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:12,971
Okay?

480
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:16,892
Okay?!

481
00:39:18,685 --> 00:39:21,313
I think we can do better than that.

482
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:28,028
Now, Brad and Janet...

483
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:30,280
what do you think of him?

484
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,366
Well...

485
00:39:32,783 --> 00:39:36,328
I don't like men with too many muscles.

486
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:40,290
I didn't make him for you!

487
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:44,962
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.

488
00:39:56,139 --> 00:40:01,353
<i>A weakling weighing 98 pounds</i>

489
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:04,564
<i>Will get sand in his face</i>

490
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:07,359
<i>When kicked to the ground</i>

491
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:11,905
<i>And soon in the gym</i>

492
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:14,908
<i>With a determined chin</i>

493
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:17,661
<i>The sweat from his pores</i>

494
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:23,875
<i>As he works for his cause</i>

495
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:26,962
<i>Will make him glisten</i>

496
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:30,340
<i>And gleam</i>

497
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:33,302
<i>And with massage</i>

498
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:38,682
<i>And just a little bit of steam</i>

499
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:45,355
<i>He'll be pink</i>

500
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:48,609
<i>And quite clean</i>

501
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:53,155
<i>He'll be a strong man</i>

502
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:58,702
<i>Oh, honey
But the wrong man</i>

503
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,041
<i>He'll eat nutritious high protein</i>

504
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,752
<i>And swallow raw eggs</i>

505
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:08,754
<i>Try to build up his shoulders</i>

506
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:12,090
<i>His chest, arms and legs</i>

507
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:17,095
<i>Such an effort
If he only knew of my plan</i>

508
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:20,724
<i>In just seven days</i>

509
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:25,604
<i>I can make you a man</i>

510
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:31,026
<i>He'll do press-ups and chin-ups</i>

511
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:33,403
<i>Do the snatch, clean and jerk</i>

512
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:37,074
<i>He thinks dynamic tension</i>

513
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:39,576
<i>Must be hard work</i>

514
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:41,703
<i>Such strenuous living</i>

515
00:41:41,954 --> 00:41:44,206
<i>I just don't understand</i>

516
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:48,961
<i>When in just seven days
Oh, baby</i>

517
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:54,049
<i>I can make you a man</i>

518
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:03,100
Eddie!

519
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:26,832
<i>Whatever happened to Saturday night</i>

520
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:32,379
<i>When you dressed sharp, felt all right
Don't seem the same since cosmic light</i>

521
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:36,174
<i>Came into my life
I thought I was divine</i>

522
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:41,513
<i>I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio</i>

523
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:44,308
<i>A saxophone was blowing
On a rock 'n' roll show</i>

524
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:49,187
<i>We climbed in the back seat
We really had a good time</i>

525
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:52,065
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

526
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:54,860
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

527
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:58,238
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

528
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:01,283
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

529
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:21,637
Lovely party!

530
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:30,354
<i>My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelled</i>

531
00:43:30,604 --> 00:43:33,440
<i>My hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic belt</i>

532
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:36,443
<i>I'd taste her baby pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt</i>

533
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:39,613
<i>She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine</i>

534
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:44,826
<i>Get in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his last song</i>

535
00:43:45,077 --> 00:43:48,080
<i>With your arms around your girl
You tried to sing along</i>

536
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,793
<i>It felt pretty good
Really had a good time</i>

537
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:56,171
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

538
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:58,215
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

539
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,593
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

540
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:04,554
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

541
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:48,575
One from the vaults.

542
00:45:59,294 --> 00:46:01,088
Oh, baby!

543
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:10,681
Don't be upset.

544
00:46:12,808 --> 00:46:15,269
It was a mercy killing.

545
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:19,231
He had a certain naive charm...

546
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:21,650
but no muscle.

547
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,989
<i>But a deltoid</i>

548
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:30,325
<i>And a bicep</i>

549
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:35,622
<i>A hot groin
And a tricep</i>

550
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:38,250
<i>Makes me...</i>

551
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:40,502
<i>shake</i>

552
00:46:40,752 --> 00:46:44,464
<i>Makes me want to take Charles Atlas</i>

553
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:47,551
<i>By the hand</i>

554
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,929
<i>In just seven days
Oh, baby</i>

555
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:56,226
<i>I can make you a man</i>

556
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:03,317
<i>I don't want no dissension</i>

557
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,531
<i>Just dynamic tension</i>

558
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:15,329
<i>I'm a muscle fan</i>

559
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:18,874
<i>In just seven days</i>

560
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:24,171
<i>I can make you a man</i>

561
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:29,301
<i>Dig it if you can</i>

562
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:33,055
<i>In just seven days</i>

563
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:37,142
<i>I can make you a man</i>

564
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,952
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!

565
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:13,762
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...

566
00:48:14,012 --> 00:48:17,683
and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.

567
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:22,062
If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.

568
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:27,109
However, the sudden departure
of their host...

569
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,237
and his creation...

570
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:33,657
into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...

571
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:38,787
had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.

572
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:42,708
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...

573
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:47,504
and they were shown
to their separate rooms.

574
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:28,003
Who is it? Who's there?

575
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:33,425
It's only me, Janet.

576
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:36,345
Brad, darling, come in.

577
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:40,515
Oh, Brad!

578
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,644
Yes, my darling! But what if...?

579
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:45,938
Everything's going to be all right.

580
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:49,483
Oh, I hope so, my darling.

581
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:56,573
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?

582
00:49:56,865 --> 00:50:01,286
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?

583
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:04,498
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?

584
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,168
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...

585
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,671
Yes. Yes, I know.

586
00:50:10,963 --> 00:50:13,256
But it isn't all bad, is it?

587
00:50:14,132 --> 00:50:17,636
I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.

588
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:20,806
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!

589
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:22,849
Brad. Oh, Brad!

590
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:28,188
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?

591
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,025
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!

592
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:34,528
I was saving myself.

593
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:39,116
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

594
00:50:39,825 --> 00:50:41,618
Promise you won't tell Brad?

595
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:44,955
Cross my heart and hope to die.

596
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:38,652
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!

597
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:40,487
It'll destroy us.

598
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:44,032
Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.

599
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:47,369
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.

600
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,000
You!

601
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,961
I'm afraid so, Brad. But isn't it nice?

602
00:52:56,211 --> 00:52:59,298
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?

603
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:02,009
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?

604
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:07,180
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!

605
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:10,142
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?

606
00:53:10,392 --> 00:53:14,479
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.

607
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:18,358
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.

608
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,110
Oh, Janet.

609
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:22,195
Janet!

610
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:26,825
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?

611
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:31,163
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.

612
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:33,498
I thought it was the real thing!

613
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:35,542
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.

614
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:37,628
You liked it, didn't you?

615
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,214
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.

616
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:45,344
Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.

617
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:49,097
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.

618
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:51,808
You promise you won't tell?

619
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:55,354
On my mother's grave.

620
00:53:56,521 --> 00:54:00,275
<i>Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.</i>

621
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:04,446
<i>The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.</i>

622
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:08,075
<i>Magenta has just released the dogs.</i>

623
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:12,454
Coming!

624
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:20,045
What's happening here? Where's Brad?

625
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:22,881
Where's anybody?

626
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:33,642
Oh, Brad!

627
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:39,356
Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?

628
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:53,662
Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey.

629
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:57,249
If only the car hadn't broken down.

630
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:03,422
If only we were amongst friends
or sane persons.

631
00:55:04,673 --> 00:55:06,883
Oh, Brad.

632
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:11,096
What have they done with him?

633
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:20,647
Brad, how could you?

634
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,341
But you're hurt.

635
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:51,094
Did they do this to you?

636
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,974
Here. I'll dress your wounds.

637
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:00,062
Baby, there. Oh.

638
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,494
<i>"Emotion: agitation or disturbance
of mind...</i>

639
00:56:15,744 --> 00:56:19,873
vehement or excited mental state."

640
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:25,712
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.

641
00:56:25,921 --> 00:56:30,759
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...

642
00:56:31,009 --> 00:56:34,680
<i>there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed...</i>

643
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,390
<i>its slave.</i>

644
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:40,102
Tell us about it, Janet.

645
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:46,775
<i>I was feeling done in</i>

646
00:56:47,442 --> 00:56:49,278
<i>Couldn't win</i>

647
00:56:50,612 --> 00:56:54,074
<i>I'd only ever kissed before</i>

648
00:56:56,201 --> 00:56:57,661
You mean she...?

649
00:56:57,953 --> 00:57:01,581
<i>I thought there's no use getting</i>

650
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,960
<i>Into heavy petting</i>

651
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,506
<i>It only leads to trouble</i>

652
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:11,883
<i>And seat wetting</i>

653
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:15,345
<i>Now all I want to know</i>

654
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:18,473
<i>Is how to go</i>

655
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:21,727
<i>I've tasted blood and I want more</i>

656
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:23,770
More, more, more.

657
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:27,065
<i>I'll put up no resistance</i>

658
00:57:27,316 --> 00:57:29,568
<i>I want to stay the distance</i>

659
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:32,487
<i>I've got an itch to scratch</i>

660
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:35,782
<i>I need assistance</i>

661
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:38,535
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

662
00:57:38,827 --> 00:57:41,413
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

663
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:44,166
<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

664
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,835
<i>Creature of the night</i>

665
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,760
<i>Then if anything grows</i>

666
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:57,679
<i>While you pose</i>

667
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,891
<i>I'll oil you up and rub you down</i>

668
00:58:01,183 --> 00:58:03,477
Down, down, down.

669
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:08,732
<i>And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction</i>

670
00:58:09,858 --> 00:58:12,069
<i>You need a friendly hand</i>

671
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:14,613
<i>Oh, and I need action</i>

672
00:58:14,863 --> 00:58:17,532
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

673
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:20,327
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

674
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:23,121
<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

<i>Creature of the night</i>

Creature of the night.

685
00:58:50,399 --> 00:58:52,526
Creature of the night?

686
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:55,028
Creature of the night.

687
00:58:55,821 --> 00:58:57,197
Creature of the night.

688
00:58:58,573 --> 00:59:00,450
Creature of the night.

689
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:02,786
<i>Creature of the night</i>

690
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:05,205
Creature of the night.

691
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:09,209
<i>Creature of the night</i>

692
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:17,551
Mercy!

693
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,972
How did it happen?

694
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:25,892
I understood you were to be watching.

695
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:29,271
I was only away for a minute, master.

696
00:59:29,521 --> 00:59:34,443
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.

697
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,826
Master.

698
00:59:43,118 --> 00:59:46,330
Master, we have a visitor.

699
00:59:51,627 --> 00:59:52,794
Hey, Scotty!

700
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:56,131
Dr. Everett Scott.

701
00:59:56,381 --> 00:59:59,718
You know this earthling... this person?

702
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:04,097
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.

703
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:06,141
I see.

704
01:00:06,892 --> 01:00:10,103
So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.

705
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:12,940
You came here with a purpose.

706
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:17,152
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.

707
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:19,905
I know what you told me, Brad.

708
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:24,910
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.

709
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:27,704
He was a science teacher at Denton High.

710
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:30,165
And now he works for your government.

711
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,877
He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...

712
01:00:34,086 --> 01:00:37,673
of that which you call UFOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?

713
01:00:37,923 --> 01:00:40,342
He might be. I don't know.

714
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:43,679
The intruder is entering
the building, master.

715
01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:50,394
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.

716
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:01,196
Shall we inquire of him in person?

717
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:36,773
Great Scott!

718
01:01:48,994 --> 01:01:50,245
Frank N. Furter.

719
01:01:51,413 --> 01:01:52,748
We meet at last.

720
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,293
Dr. Scott!

721
01:01:56,752 --> 01:01:58,879
Brad! What are you doing here?

722
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:02,507
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.

723
01:02:03,342 --> 01:02:06,428
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.

724
01:02:06,762 --> 01:02:08,805
It was part of your plan, was it not?

725
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:12,893
That he and his female
should check the layout for you?

726
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:18,023
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.

727
01:02:19,524 --> 01:02:22,527
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.

728
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:25,030
I know Brad is.

729
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,368
I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.

730
01:02:29,618 --> 01:02:31,495
I came here to find Eddie.

731
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:34,706
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?

732
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:36,792
What do you know of Eddie?

733
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,545
I know a great deal
about a lot of things.

734
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:43,840
You see, Eddie happens to be my nephew.

735
01:02:49,137 --> 01:02:50,681
Dr. Scott.

736
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:56,520
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

737
01:02:56,812 --> 01:02:58,063
- Janet!
- Brad!

738
01:02:58,313 --> 01:02:59,398
Rocky!

739
01:02:59,648 --> 01:03:01,316
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

740
01:03:01,566 --> 01:03:03,026
- Janet!
- Brad!

741
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:04,403
Rocky!

742
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:12,369
Listen! I made you...

743
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:16,331
and I can break you just as easily.

744
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:22,296
Master, dinner is prepared!

745
01:03:25,173 --> 01:03:26,508
Excellent.

746
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:32,389
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.

747
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:39,688
Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:

748
01:03:39,938 --> 01:03:44,526
The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man...

749
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:48,155
and now this meal.

750
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,617
<i>However informal it might appear...</i>

751
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:56,204
<i>you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.</i>

752
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:13,865
A toast.

753
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:17,953
To absent friends.

754
01:05:18,453 --> 01:05:20,455
To absent friends.

755
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:26,712
And Rocky.

756
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:37,514
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

757
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:39,683
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

758
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:41,935
<i>Happy birthday, dear Rocky</i>

759
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:44,104
- <i>Happy birthday...</i>
- Shall we?

760
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,709
We came here to discuss Eddie.

761
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:07,336
Eddie!

762
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,342
It's a rather tender subject.

763
01:06:14,092 --> 01:06:16,136
Another slice, anyone?

764
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:24,061
Excuse me.

765
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:39,618
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.

766
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:41,495
Aliens!

767
01:06:41,787 --> 01:06:42,704
Dr. Scott!

768
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:45,123
Go on, Dr. Scott.

769
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:49,670
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?

770
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:53,048
Just what exactly are you implying?

771
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:54,508
It's all right!

772
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:56,468
That's all right, Brad.

773
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,391
<i>From the day he was born</i>

774
01:07:05,227 --> 01:07:08,063
<i>He was trouble</i>

775
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:12,859
<i>He was the thorn</i>

776
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:17,864
<i>In his mother's side</i>

777
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:23,078
<i>She tried in vain</i>

778
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:30,377
<i>But he never caused her
Nothing but shame</i>

779
01:07:31,336 --> 01:07:34,673
<i>He left home...</i>

780
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:38,135
<i>the day she died</i>

781
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:40,596
<i>From the day she was gone</i>

782
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,724
<i>All he wanted</i>

783
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,852
<i>Was rock 'n' roll porn</i>

784
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:49,980
Und <i>a motorbike</i>

785
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:53,108
<i>Shooting up junk</i>

786
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:57,321
<i>He was a low-down, cheap little punk</i>

787
01:07:57,613 --> 01:08:02,701
<i>Taking everyone for a ride</i>

788
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:06,288
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

789
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:08,999
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

790
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:12,085
<i>But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

791
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:13,754
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Makes you cry</i>

792
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:15,422
Und <i>I did</i>

793
01:08:15,964 --> 01:08:18,800
<i>Everybody shoved him</i>

794
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:22,095
<i>I very nearly loved him</i>

795
01:08:22,387 --> 01:08:25,057
<i>I said, hey, listen to me</i>

796
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:28,185
<i>Stay sane inside insanity</i>

797
01:08:28,477 --> 01:08:33,565
<i>But he locked the door
And threw away the key</i>

798
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:35,692
<i>But he must've been drawn</i>

799
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:39,029
<i>Into something</i>

800
01:08:40,322 --> 01:08:42,449
<i>Making him warn me</i>

801
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,368
<i>In a note which reads:</i>

802
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:46,078
<i>What's it say? What's it say?</i>

803
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:47,704
<i>"I'm out of my head</i>

804
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:52,334
<i>Oh, hurry, or I may be dead</i>

805
01:08:52,918 --> 01:08:58,048
<i>They mustn't carry out
Their evil deeds"</i>

806
01:08:59,341 --> 01:09:02,135
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

807
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:04,137
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

808
01:09:04,846 --> 01:09:07,516
<i>When he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

809
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:09,434
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Makes you cry</i>

810
01:09:09,685 --> 01:09:11,103
Und <i>I did</i>

811
01:09:11,353 --> 01:09:13,814
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

812
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,441
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

813
01:09:16,692 --> 01:09:19,945
<i>But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

814
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,617
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Woe, woe, woe</i>

815
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:30,497
- <i>Makes you cry</i>
- <i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

816
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:34,209
Und <i>I did</i>

817
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:38,255
<i>Hey</i>

818
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:40,924
Oh.

819
01:09:52,477 --> 01:09:53,895
Oh, Rocky!

820
01:09:56,064 --> 01:09:58,233
How could you?!

821
01:10:06,241 --> 01:10:08,035
This way! This way!

822
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:12,289
Shut up!

823
01:10:13,832 --> 01:10:17,002
<i>I'll tell you once
I won't tell you twice</i>

824
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:20,797
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

825
01:10:21,089 --> 01:10:24,426
<i>Your apple pie
Don't taste too nice</i>

826
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:28,013
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

827
01:10:34,853 --> 01:10:38,315
<i>I've laid the seed
It should be all you need</i>

828
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:40,484
<i>You're as sensual as a pencil</i>

829
01:10:40,776 --> 01:10:42,361
<i>Wound up like an E or first string</i>

830
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:45,155
<i>When we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?</i>

831
01:10:45,864 --> 01:10:48,951
<i>You got a block
Well, take my advice</i>

832
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:53,288
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

833
01:10:53,705 --> 01:10:57,209
<i>The transducer
Will seduce ya</i>

834
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:02,089
My feet! I can't move my feet!

835
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,425
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.

836
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:09,137
It's as if we were glued to the spot.

837
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:11,223
You are.

838
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:15,018
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.

839
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:17,854
We're trapped.

840
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:22,484
<i>It's something you'll get used to
A mental mind fuck can be nice</i>

841
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:23,527
No!

842
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:26,989
You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.

843
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,199
This sonic transducer...

844
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:33,870
it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?

845
01:11:34,162 --> 01:11:35,664
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.

846
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:39,376
It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.

847
01:11:39,668 --> 01:11:43,463
But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.

848
01:11:43,755 --> 01:11:47,009
A device capable
of breaking down solid matter...

849
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:50,637
and then projecting it
through space, and who knows...

850
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:54,433
perhaps even time itself!

851
01:11:54,683 --> 01:11:57,102
He's gonna send us to another planet?

852
01:11:57,352 --> 01:12:00,480
Planet schmanet, Janet.

853
01:12:01,106 --> 01:12:04,109
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

854
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:08,363
<i>You'd better wise up
Build your thighs up</i>

855
01:12:08,572 --> 01:12:10,073
<i>You'd better wise up</i>

856
01:12:10,365 --> 01:12:12,451
And then she cried out:

857
01:12:12,743 --> 01:12:14,453
Stop!

858
01:12:18,624 --> 01:12:23,754
<i>Don't get hot and flustered</i>

859
01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:28,800
<i>Use a bit of mustard</i>

860
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:31,720
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

861
01:12:32,012 --> 01:12:34,681
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

862
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:37,976
<i>try to hurt her</i>

863
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:39,603
<i>Frank Furter</i>

864
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:43,398
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

865
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:46,443
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

866
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:49,655
<i>try to hurt her</i>

867
01:12:50,072 --> 01:12:51,490
<i>Frank Furter</i>

868
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,826
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

869
01:12:57,245 --> 01:13:01,166
My God! I can't stand any more of this.

870
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:06,338
First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.

871
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:10,300
You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.

872
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:12,427
I loved you.

873
01:13:13,095 --> 01:13:14,888
Do you hear me? I loved you.

874
01:13:15,097 --> 01:13:18,642
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.

875
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:23,063
You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.

876
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,898
Well, I've had enough!

877
01:13:25,148 --> 01:13:29,236
Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.

878
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:42,833
It's not easy, having a good time.

879
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:54,303
Even smiling makes my face ache.

880
01:13:57,723 --> 01:14:00,559
And my children turn on me.

881
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:04,313
Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.

882
01:14:07,065 --> 01:14:08,317
Maybe I made a mistake...

883
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:11,403
splitting his brain
between the two of them.

884
01:14:11,653 --> 01:14:13,947
I grow weary of this world!

885
01:14:14,197 --> 01:14:17,451
When shall we return to Transylvania?!

886
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:20,162
Magenta...

887
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:24,458
I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.

888
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,252
You have both served me well.

889
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:31,548
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.

890
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,428
You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.

891
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:39,765
I ask for nothing, master.

892
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:44,353
And you shall receive it in abundance!

893
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:49,775
Come. We are ready for the floorshow.

894
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:23,016
<i>And so, by some extraordinary
coincidence...</i>

895
01:15:23,225 --> 01:15:26,144
fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...

896
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:30,274
should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.

897
01:15:30,565 --> 01:15:32,442
But it was to be in a situation...

898
01:15:32,734 --> 01:15:35,862
which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.

899
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:40,534
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement...

900
01:15:40,784 --> 01:15:44,413
Brad and Janet had both tasted...

901
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,332
forbidden fruit.

902
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:50,502
This in itself was proof...

903
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:54,131
that their host
was a man of little morals...

904
01:15:54,423 --> 01:15:57,342
and some persuasion.

905
01:15:58,093 --> 01:16:02,764
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?

906
01:16:03,098 --> 01:16:07,978
And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?

907
01:16:08,604 --> 01:16:11,356
In an empty house...

908
01:16:11,607 --> 01:16:14,568
in the middle of the night?

909
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,571
What diabolical plan...

910
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:21,950
had seized Frank's crazed imagination?

911
01:16:23,869 --> 01:16:25,912
What indeed?

912
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,125
From what had gone before,
it was clear...

913
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:33,879
that this was to be no picnic.

914
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:06,203
<i>It was great when it all began</i>

915
01:17:06,495 --> 01:17:11,166
<i>I was a regular Frankie fan</i>

916
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:14,836
<i>But it was over when he had the plan</i>

917
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:19,299
<i>To start working on a muscleman</i>

918
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:23,262
<i>Now the only thing that gives me hope</i>

919
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:28,058
<i>Is my love of a certain dope</i>

920
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,894
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

921
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:34,982
<i>Keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain</i>

922
01:17:36,483 --> 01:17:40,404
<i>I'm just seven hours old</i>

923
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:43,657
<i>Truly beautiful to behold</i>

924
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,495
<i>And somebody should be told</i>

925
01:17:48,787 --> 01:17:52,708
<i>My libido hasn't been controlled</i>

926
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:57,045
<i>Now the only thing I've come to trust</i>

927
01:17:57,462 --> 01:18:01,633
<i>Is an orgasmic rush of lust</i>

928
01:18:01,967 --> 01:18:03,510
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

929
01:18:03,802 --> 01:18:08,098
<i>And keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain</i>

930
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:14,396
<i>It's beyond me</i>

931
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:18,775
<i>Help me, Mommy</i>

932
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:22,738
<i>I'll be good, you'll see</i>

933
01:18:22,988 --> 01:18:26,450
<i>Take this dream away</i>

934
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:29,703
<i>What's this</i>

935
01:18:29,995 --> 01:18:31,872
<i>Let's see</i>

936
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:35,626
<i>I feel sexy</i>

937
01:18:37,085 --> 01:18:39,796
<i>What's come over me</i>

938
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:43,008
<i>Here it comes again</i>

939
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:50,057
<i>I feel released</i>

940
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:53,560
<i>Bad times deceased</i>

941
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:57,022
<i>My confidence has increased</i>

942
01:18:58,357 --> 01:19:01,485
<i>Reality is here</i>

943
01:19:01,693 --> 01:19:05,906
<i>The game has been disbanded</i>

944
01:19:06,156 --> 01:19:09,618
<i>My mind has been expanded</i>

945
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:13,038
<i>It's a gas that Frankie's landed</i>

946
01:19:14,206 --> 01:19:18,794
<i>His lust is so sincere</i>

947
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:56,456
<i>Whatever happened...</i>

948
01:19:56,748 --> 01:19:59,251
<i>to Fay Wray</i>

949
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:01,587
<i>That delicate...</i>

950
01:20:01,837 --> 01:20:06,383
<i>satin-draped frame</i>

951
01:20:07,593 --> 01:20:11,763
<i>As it clung to her thigh</i>

952
01:20:12,097 --> 01:20:17,185
<i>How I started to cry</i>

953
01:20:18,645 --> 01:20:21,607
<i>'Cause I wanted to be dressed</i>

954
01:20:21,857 --> 01:20:26,153
<i>Just the same</i>

955
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:29,615
<i>Give yourself over</i>

956
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:33,910
<i>To absolute pleasure</i>

957
01:20:34,202 --> 01:20:37,247
<i>Swim the warm waters</i>

958
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:41,209
<i>Of sins of the flesh</i>

959
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,296
<i>Erotic nightmares</i>

960
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:48,300
<i>Beyond any measure</i>

961
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,845
<i>And sensual daydreams</i>

962
01:20:52,137 --> 01:20:56,642
<i>To treasure forever</i>

963
01:20:56,892 --> 01:21:02,022
<i>Can't you just see it</i>

964
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:18,497
<i>Don't dream it</i>

965
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:22,668
<i>Be it</i>

966
01:21:22,918 --> 01:21:26,630
<i>Don't dream it</i>

967
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:30,384

01:21:30,634 --> 01:21:33,720
<i>Don't dream it</i>

969
01:21:35,097 --> 01:21:36,932
<i>Be it</i>

970
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:50,070
<i>Don't dream it</i>

971
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:52,864
<i>Be it</i>

972
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:26,273
We've got to get...

973
01:22:26,565 --> 01:22:28,358
out of this trap...

974
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:33,363
before this decadence...

975
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:36,450
saps our wills.

976
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:40,037
I've got to be strong...

01:22:40,454 --> 01:22:42,956

978
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,543
Or else my mind...

979
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:50,255

01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:19,321
I can explain.

<i>Wheeling</i>

1036
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:20,025

01:28:45,777 --> 01:28:48,822
How sentimental.

1050
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:02,544
And also presumptuous of you.

1051
01:29:04,546 --> 01:29:07,591
You see, when I said "we"...

1052
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,427
were to return to Transylvania...

1053
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,055
I referred only to Magenta and myself.

1054
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,392
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading...

1055
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:18,685
but you see...

1056
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:21,772
you are to remain here.

1057
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:24,691
In spirit anyway.

1058
01:29:26,318 --> 01:29:28,028
Good heavens, that's a laser.

1059
01:29:28,236 --> 01:29:29,613
Yes, Dr. Scott.

1060
01:29:30,405 --> 01:29:34,284
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.

1061
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:37,120
You're going to kill him?

1062
01:29:37,746 --> 01:29:40,749
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.

1063
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:43,210
Society must be protected.

1064
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:45,754
Exactly, Dr. Scott.

1065
01:29:46,004 --> 01:29:48,882
Now, Frank N. Furter, your time has come

1066
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:53,053
Say goodbye to all of this...

1067
01:29:54,429 --> 01:29:58,350
and hello to oblivion.

1068
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:16,827
No.

1069
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:18,370
No.

1070
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,163
No!

1071
01:31:50,295 --> 01:31:51,713
Good God!

1072
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:54,216
You killed them.

1073
01:31:54,466 --> 01:31:59,221
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.

1074
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:02,349
They didn't like me!

1075
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:05,686
They never liked me!

1076
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:07,771
You did right.

1077
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:25,080
A decision had to be made.

1078
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,791
You're okay by me.

1079
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:30,919
Dr. Scott...

1080
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:36,258
I'm sorry about your nephew.

1081
01:32:36,508 --> 01:32:37,801
Eddie?

1082
01:32:38,343 --> 01:32:41,555
Yes, well, perhaps it was for the best.

1083
01:32:43,932 --> 01:32:48,020
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.

1084
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:51,023
We are about to beam the entire house...

1085
01:32:51,273 --> 01:32:53,984
back to the planet of Transsexual...

1086
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:57,404
in the galaxy of Transylvania.

1087
01:32:58,947 --> 01:33:00,115
Go.

1088
01:33:01,366 --> 01:33:02,618
Now.

1089
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:19,301
Our noble mission is almost completed...

1090
01:33:20,802 --> 01:33:23,055
my most beautiful sister.

1091
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:28,268
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores...

1092
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,771
of our beloved planet.

1093
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:36,818
Sweet Transsexual.

1094
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:40,781
Land of night.

1095
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:46,828
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.

1096
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:53,919
To take that...

1097
01:33:55,754 --> 01:33:58,924
step to the right.

1098
01:34:00,926 --> 01:34:03,720
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

1099
01:34:04,012 --> 01:34:07,266
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

1100
01:34:07,849 --> 01:34:10,811
And our world...

1101
01:34:11,103 --> 01:34:16,024
will do the time warp again!

1102
01:34:35,952 --> 01:34:39,539
<i>I've done a lot</i>

1103
01:34:39,623 --> 01:34:43,793
<i>God knows I've tried</i>

1104
01:34:43,877 --> 01:34:47,589
<i>To find the truth</i>

1105
01:34:47,672 --> 01:34:52,177
<i>I've even lied</i>

1106
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:55,889
<i>But al I I know</i>

1107
01:34:55,972 --> 01:34:59,184
<i>Is down Inside I'm</i>

1108
01:34:59,309 --> 01:35:03,897
<i>Bleeding
Bleeding</i>

1109
01:35:08,026 --> 01:35:12,405
<i>And superheroes</i>

1110
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:15,992
<i>Come to feast</i>

1111
01:35:16,076 --> 01:35:19,663
<i>To taste the flesh</i>

1112
01:35:19,746 --> 01:35:23,667
<i>Not yet deceased</i>

1113
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:27,462
<i>And all I know</i>

1114
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:30,882
<i>Is still the beast is</i>

1115
01:35:31,007 --> 01:35:35,387
<i>Feeding
Feeding</i>

1116
01:36:26,188 --> 01:36:28,190
<i>And crawling</i>

1117
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:32,152
<i>On the planet's face</i>

1118
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:35,697
<i>Some insects</i>

1119
01:36:36,615 --> 01:36:39,451
<i>Called the human race</i>

1120
01:36:41,453 --> 01:36:43,830
<i>Lost in time</i>

1121
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:49,253
<i>And lost in space</i>

1122
01:36:49,962 --> 01:36:51,964
<i>And meaning</i>

1123
01:36:53,215 --> 01:36:55,759
<i>Meaning</i>
