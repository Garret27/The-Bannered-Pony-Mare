Okay if I sit closer?

32
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,731
How far are you going?

33
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,858
Rockville Center.

34
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,568
Get out. Me, too.

35
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,028
Really?

36
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,112
What are the odds?

37
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,784
Listen, do I know you?

38
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,956
Do you ever shop
at Barnes and Noble?

39
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,207
Sure.

40
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,917
That's it!
Yeah?

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,502
I've seen you, man.

42
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,840
Book slave there
for five years now.

43
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,466
Jesus!

44
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,552
I would have thought
I would remember you.

45
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,470
It might be the hair.

46
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,555
What might?

47
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,473
It changes a lot,
the color.

48
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,976
That's why you might
not recognize me.

49
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,103
It's called Blue Ruin.
Right.

50
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
The color.
Snappy name, huh?

51
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,481
I like it.

52
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,363
This company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:07,033
You've got Red Menace,
Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

54
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,412
That would be a job,
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,373
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,210
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? 15 maybe?

57
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,588
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,216
Agent Orange.
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,803
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,139
I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,311
Well, you don't know me,
so you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,443
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be nice.

63
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,988
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,468
My name's Clementine,
by the way.

65
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,719
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,512
Hi, Joel.

67
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,809
Oh, no.
You wouldn't do that.

69
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,603
You're trying to be nice.

70
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,648
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

71
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,399
Huckleberry Hound.

72
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
I don't know
what that means.

73
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,614
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

74
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,532
It's been suggested.

75
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine</i>

76
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:38,083
<i>You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine</i>

77
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,626
No?

78
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,086
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,005
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

80
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,051
It means merciful, right?
Clemency?

81
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,512
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,889
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

83
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,016
I wouldn't think that
about you.

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,310
Why wouldn't you think that
about me?

85
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,396
I don't know.

86
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,985
You seem nice.

87
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,070
Now I'm nice?

88
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,323
Oh, God, don't you know
any other adjectives?

89
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,159
I don't need nice.
I don't need myself to be it

90
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
and I don't need anybody
to be it at me.

91
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,329
Okay.

92
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,837
It's Joel, right?

93
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,214
Yes.

94
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,551
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

95
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,679
I'm a little
out of sorts today.

96
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,190
My embarrassing admission

97
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,818
is I really like
that you're nice right now.

98
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,365
I can't tell from one moment to
the next what I'm going to like,

99
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,952
but right now
I'm glad you are.

100
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,630
I have some stuff
that I probably should...

101
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,886
I'm writing...
I'm sorry. Okay.

102
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,637
No.
Sure. That's okay.

103
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,601
Take care, then.

104
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,810
Jesus.

105
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,245
I could give you a ride
if you need.

106
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,331
It's cold.

107
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeah ! Okay. It is frosty.

108
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,920
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?

109
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,798
I'm not a stalker. You're the
one that talked to me, remember?

110
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,092
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

111
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,636
Really?
There's a stalker book?

112
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,265
I've got to read that one.

113
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,148
Look, I'm sorry
if I came off sort of nutso.

114
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,025
I'm not really.

115
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,278
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.

116
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,829
Do you want
to have a drink?

117
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,498
I have lots of drinks,
and I could...

118
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,629
Never mind. Sorry, that was
stupid. I'm embarrassed now.

119
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,339
Good night, Joel.

120
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,861
Two Blue Ruins.

121
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,156
Thank you.

122
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,532
Drink up, young man.

123
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,536
It'll make the whole
seduction part less repugnant.

124
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm just kidding !
Come on.

125
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,676
You're kind of close-mouthed,
aren't you?

126
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,927
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,473
You know, my life isn't
that interesting.

128
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,352
I go to work, I come home.

129
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,606
I don't know what to say.

130
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,442
You should read my journal.

131
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,279
I mean, it's just blank.

132
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,991
Really? Does that
make you sad or anxious?

133
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,536
I'm always anxious, thinking
I'm not living my life to the fullest.

134
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,538
Taking advantage
of every possibility

135
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,334
and making sure I'm not wasting
one second of the little time I have.

136
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,669
I think about that.
Yeah?

137
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,218
You're really nice.

138
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,429
God, I have to stop
saying that.

139
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,184
I'm gonna marry you.
I know it.

140
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,104
Okay.

141
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,155
Joel, you should come up to
the Charles with me sometime.

142
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,491
It gets frozen
this time of year.

143
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,576
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

144
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,497
I'll pack a picnic,
a night picnic.

145
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,999
Night picnics are different.

146
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,419
That sounds good.

147
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,589
But I should go now.

148
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,259
You should stay.

149
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,718
No, I really have...

150
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,388
I have to get up
so early and...

151
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,265
I would like you
to call me.

152
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,767
Would you do that?
I'd like it.

153
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,851
Yes.

154
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,401
Wish me a happy
Valentine's Day when you call.

155
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,152
That'd be nice.

00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,315
What are you doing?

179
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,152
Come on.

180
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,493
Think I heard a crack.

181
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,080
It's not going to crack.
Or break.

182
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,623
It's so thick.

183
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,920
Show me which
constellations you know.

184
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,550
I don't know any.

185
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,429
Show me which ones
you know.

186
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,513
Okay.

187
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,229
There's Osidius.

188
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,522
Where?

189
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,108
Right there. See?

190
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,694
A sort of a swoop
and a cross.

191
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,113
Osidius the Emphatic.

192
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,616
You're full of shit, right?

193
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,827
No. Osidius, right there.

194
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,954
Swoop and a cross.

195
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,873
Shut the fuck up!

196
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,139
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

197
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,771
Sorry to wake you,
but we're here.

198
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,742
Can I come over
to your house,

199
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,079
to sleep? I'm so tired.

200
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,417
Okay. Yeah, sure.

201
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,920
Let me get my toothbrush.

202
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,818
Yes?

203
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,112
Can I help you?

204
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,281
What do you mean?

205
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,368
Can I help you
with something?

206
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,453
No.

207
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,248
What are you doing here?

208
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,042
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

209
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,296
Thanks.

210
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,448
We're looking for 159.

211
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,783
What number is that?

212
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,242
I don't know
what number that is.

213
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,787
Jesus Christ. You'd think
they'd light the number

214
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,205
or at least put
a number on...

215
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,623
Is that him?
I think so.

216
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,333
Yeah, that's him.

217
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,126
That's him.

218
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,102
Hey, Joel.
Frank.

219
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,107
Shit.

220
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,569
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day
cards I get are from my mother.

221
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,613
How pathetic is that?

222
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,242
You're lucky you have
Clementine. She is way cool.

223
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,245
You got any big Valentine's
Day plans with her?

224
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,291
No.

225
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,545
It's only a day away. Better make
some reservations or something.

226
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,839
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's, right?

227
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,257
McRomance!

228
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,175
You want some fries
with that shake?

229
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,554
I have to go to sleep now,
Frank.

230
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,556
It's 8:30.

231
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,961
Patrick, stop it.

232
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,523
Okay.

233
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,449
Showtime at the Apollo.

234
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,879
Quiet.

235
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,015
Get it off your head.

236
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,520
Hey, Joel.
What's up?

237
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,314
Hi, Frank.

238
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:05,241
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom. How pathetic is that?

239
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,245
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

240
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,915
You got any big Valentine's
Day plans with her?

241
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,251
No.

242
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,255
It's only a day away. Better
make a reservation somewhere.

243
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,174
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's.

244
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,885
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

245
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,430
Valentine's Day is three
days away. I want it resolved.

246
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,683
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

247
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,769
So I call her, and she's
changed her number.

248
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,356
<i>So I walked over to
Antic Attic to get her something.</i>

249
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,068
<i>I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early Valentine.</i>

250
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,905
And you won't believe it.

251
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,617
She's there with this guy,

252
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,161
this really young guy.

253
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,124
And she looks at me like she
doesn't even know who I am.

254
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,792
Excuse me?

255
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,378
Can I help you
find something, sir?

256
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,925
Hey, Clem-ato.

257
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,804
Patrick! Baby boy!

258
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,601
What are you doing here,
baby?

259
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,060
Just came to surprise you.

260
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,646
Let me know
if you need something, sir.

261
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,774
How are you?

262
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,319
Pretty good, pretty bored,
pretty tired.

263
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,655
I so want what's
in your suit. Good.

264
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,756
Why would she
do that to me?

265
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,678
Does anybody want a joint?

266
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,681
God, Rob, give it a rest.

267
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,434
God, she's punishing me.
I know.

268
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,603
For being honest.
It's horrible.

269
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,271
- I should just go to
her house. - No.

270
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,732
You don't want to go there,
man.

271
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,526
Get off me. It's too...
Right.

272
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,279
Yeah. I don't want
to seem desperate.

273
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,823
Joel, why don't you
just see this as a sign?

274
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,284
Make a clean break. Right?

275
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,791
All right, Joel.

276
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,752
Look, man, seriously,
here's the deal.

277
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,588
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?

278
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,757
What's your
fucking suggestion?

279
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,592
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

280
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,302
You're making this
about our shit now?

281
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,679
This isn't about us.
I agree.

282
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,765
It's not about us. It's about
Joel, who's an adult, okay?

283
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,725
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

284
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,230
Why don't you go
do your laundry?

285
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,775
That's great.
That's good.

286
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,247
Okay.

287
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,547
- What is it?
- I don't know.

288
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,216
It's some place
that does a thing.

289
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,772
Good morning. Lacuna.

290
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,110
No, I'm sorry. That offer
expired after the New Year.

291
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,115
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

292
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,742
How about on the 5th?

293
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,453
That's a Wednesday.

294
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,247
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

295
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,292
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

296
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,171
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

297
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,298
May I help you?

298
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,675
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

299
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,595
I'm Joel Barish.

300
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,513
I have an appointment
with Doctor...

301
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,933
Mierzwiak. Here, can
you please fill this out?

302
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,226
I just want to talk to him.

303
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,062
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.

304
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,855
All right.
Thank you.

305
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,859
I don't have a pen.

306
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,527
There's a pen right there.

307
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,739
Good morning. Lacuna.

308
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,116
Yeah, that offer,
that's done now.

309
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,993
That expired
after the New Year.

310
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,578
Mr. Barish?

311
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,083
How are we today?

312
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,459
Not too good, actually.

313
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,337
Oh, my God ! Stan!

314
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,005
Sorry, I was just...

315
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,256
I'm working.

316
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,595
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

317
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,682
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.

318
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,107
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem's...

319
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,025
- I assure you, no.
- No.

320
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,660
There's no such thing as this.

321
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,123
Look, our files are
confidential, Mr. Barish,

322
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,208
so I can't show you evidence.

323
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,793
Suffice it to say

324
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,547
that Miss Kruczynski
was not happy

325
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,091
and she wanted to move on.

326
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,010
<i>We provide that possibility.</i>

327
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,058
"We provide that possibility."

328
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,519
What the hell is that?

329
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,355
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

330
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,523
Fuck!

331
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,152
Rob, give it a rest!

332
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,486
It's okay.
It's all right.

333
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,780
Carrie,
I am making a birdhouse.

334
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,995
What can I say? You know,
Clementine's just like that.

335
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,913
She's impulsive.

336
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,250
She decided to
erase you almost as a lark.

337
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,672
A lark?

338
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,593
Why did you do that?

339
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,639
Don't. Wait.

340
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,225
I'm sorry, Doctor,
he just barged right in here.

341
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,810
Okay. I want it done.

342
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,354
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time...

343
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,481
That's okay, Mary.

344
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,816
But there are
people waiting.

345
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,402
Mr. Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

346
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,696
If you'd take care of Mrs.
Woo. MARY: Yes, of course.

347
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,198
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.

348
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,249
The first thing we need
you to do, Mr. Barish,

349
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,128
<i>is to go home and collect
everything you own</i>

350
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,923
<i>that has some association
with Clementine.</i>

351
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,383
<i>Anything.</i>

352
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,512
<i>We'll use these items</i>

353
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,308
<i>to create a map of Clementine
in your brain, okay?</i>

354
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,520
<i>We'll need photos,</i>

355
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,733
<i>clothing, gifts,
books she may have bought you,</i>

356
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,862
<i>CDs you may have bought
together, journal entries.</i>

357
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,990
<i>We want to empty your home,</i>

358
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,327
<i>we want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

359
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,579
<i>And after the mapping is done,</i>

360
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,999
<i>our technicians will do the
erasing in your home tonight.</i>

361
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,044
<i>That way,
when you awake in the morning,</i>

362
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,922
<i>you'll find yourself
in your own bed</i>

363
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,093
<i>as if nothing had happened,
a new life awaiting you.</i>

364
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,182
Wake up, buddy!

365
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,982
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

366
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,944
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

367
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,280
It's just not
our policy here.

368
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,198
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

369
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,867
Hello, I'm right here.

370
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,288
I know it's an emergency.
We'll do everything we can.

371
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,956
We can fit you in
on March 1.

372
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,875
Maybe you could
talk to the doctor and...

373
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,753
All right, so let's
make an appointment.

374
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,797
What day would you like
to come in this week?

375
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,967
Mr. Barish. He's really
busy this afternoon.

376
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,345
Maybe tomorrow would
be better, around 12: 15.

377
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,555
Can you do that?

378
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,517
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

379
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:21,903
This is Stan Fink, one of our most
experienced and skilled technicians.

380
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,033
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

381
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,201
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

382
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,954
My name is Joel Barish,

383
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,624
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

384
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,921
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.

385
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,803
I was living with this woman,
Naomi,

386
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,931
a couple years ago.

387
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,059
And my friends,
Rob and Carrie,

388
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,894
<i>invited us
to this party at the beach.</i>

389
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,228
<i>I don't like parties.</i>

390
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,190
<i>Naomi couldn't go,
but I went</i>

391
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,610
<i>and I met Clementine.</i>

392
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,030
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,283
We'll start with
your most recent memories

394
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,286
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

395
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,873
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories,

396
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,917
and when you eradicate
that core,

397
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,628
it starts
its degradation process.

398
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,797
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

399
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,884
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared.

400
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,053
As in a dream upon waking.

401
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,139
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

402
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,228
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

403
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,439
But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

404
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,149
Nothing you'll miss.

405
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,486
Comfortable?

406
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,947
What we're doing here,
Mr. Barish,

407
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,658
is actually creating a map
of your brain.

408
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,576
Okay, let's get started.

409
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,954
If we want to get this
procedure underway tonight,

410
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,414
we have some work to do.

411
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,000
I want you to react to these
objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.

412
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,256
There's a good story
behind that...

413
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,717
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a
much better emotional read-out

414
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,638
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

415
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,640
Just please try to
focus on the memories.

416
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,058
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,022
Healthy activity up there
again. Healthy read-outs.

418
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,482
Very good.

419
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,359
Here's another object.

420
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,319
Next item.

421
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,867
Potato head.

422
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,201
Next item.

423
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,664
<i>Just focus
on the memories.</i>

424
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,125
<i>Patrick, do me a favor.</i>

425
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,628
Patrick,
do me a favor, will you?

426
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,632
Can you check the voltage
regulator? What have we got there?

427
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,885
Voltage looks fine.
Really?

428
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,721
I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.

429
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,313
<i>Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.</i>

430
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,982
<i>But it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.</i>

431
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,359
Check the connections, please.

432
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,071
There you are.

433
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,496
What am I...

434
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,248
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

435
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,168
Why am I standing here...

436
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,920
Oh, my God, déjá vu.

437
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,217
This is so...
We should get started.

438
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,594
If we want to get the
procedure underway tonight,

439
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,137
we have some work to do.

440
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,598
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

441
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,016
I suppose so.

442
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,727
This is about right.

443
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,104
This is
what it would look like.

444
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,900
Very good.

445
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,111
We'll dispose of these
mementos when we're done here.

446
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,696
That way you won't
be confused later

447
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,658
by their unexplainable
presence in your home.

448
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,785
There we go. Patrick?

449
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,080
Patrick?

450
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,290
Patrick?

451
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,043
Why are there
so many wires?

452
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>Because we have
a lot of equipment.</i>

453
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,713
Does that help?

454
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,508
<i>Are you sure you set
that thing up properly?</i>

455
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,677
<i>How's that?</i>
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

456
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,054
- There we are, Mr. Barish.
<i>- All right, that's better.</i>

457
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,264
I don't know if I like this.

458
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,432
I think I might
try this then.

459
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,934
We're almost done now.

460
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,436
Your journal.
That'll be invaluable.

461
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,233
<i>"I met someone
tonight. I don't know what to do.</i>

462
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,819
<i>"Her name is Clementine
and she's amazing."</i>

463
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,946
Jesus!

464
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,824
What? Come on,
careful ! Step back!

465
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,201
Just take it easy.

466
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,453
It's fine.

467
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,997
Let's not roach the guy.

468
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,877
All right.
We got that one.

469
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,046
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

470
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,923
It's an apartment, Patrick.

471
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,511
Well, not a
dump then, but sort of plain.

472
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,804
Uninspired.

473
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,849
And there's sort
of a stale smell.

474
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,478
Can we just please
get through this?

475
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,314
We've got
a long night ahead of us.

476
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,323
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

477
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,465
It's 3:00.

478
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:38,094
I kind of,
sort of wrecked your car.

479
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,681
Driving drunk.
It's pathetic.

480
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,143
I was a little tipsy.

481
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,895
Don't call me pathetic!

482
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,229
It is pathetic.

483
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,190
It's fucking irresponsible.

484
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,900
You could have
killed somebody.

485
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,320
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?

486
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,865
Should I check the grille to see if
there's children or small animals?

487
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,993
It's just a fucking dent. You're
like an old lady or something.

488
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,662
What are you like?

489
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,874
A wino?
A "wino"? Jesus.

490
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,378
Are you from the '50s
or something? A "wino"?

491
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,339
Face it, Joely.

492
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,259
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you.

493
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,262
And in your little,
wormy brain,

494
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,264
you're trying to figure out,

495
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,975
"Did she fuck
someone tonight?"

496
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,772
Now, see, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

497
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,651
Isn't that how you
get people to like you?

498
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,372
I'm sorry, okay?

499
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,125
Clem, I didn't mean it,
all right?

500
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,967
Your keys.
I won't need them anymore.

501
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,806
I was just angry or annoyed
or something. I don't know.

502
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,651
Got it.

503
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,946
Mary's coming over tonight.

504
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,615
Just thought
you'd want to know.

505
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,242
I like Mary.

506
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,036
I like when she comes to
visit. I don't think she likes me.

507
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,580
She likes you okay.

508
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,250
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

509
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,376
I have a girlfriend now.

510
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,919
Do whatever you want.

511
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,504
Did I tell you...

512
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,387
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

513
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,681
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

514
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,767
The thing is,

515
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,187
my situation is
a little weird.

516
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,397
My girlfriend situation.

517
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,149
I'm sure it is.

518
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,610
You've got to be...

519
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,387
Clem, let me drive you home.

520
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,306
Get out of my face, faggot!

521
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,852
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

522
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,522
I'm erasing you,
and I'm happy!

523
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,899
You did it to me first!

524
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,694
I can't believe you did
this to me! God damn it!

525
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,447
Did you hear me?

526
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,408
By morning you'll be gone!

527
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,079
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

528
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,546
<i>Is there something
wrong with a girl being attracted to me?</i>

529
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,507
<i>- Is that a problem?
- No, I think it's funny.</i>

530
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,010
<i>Who do you think's
better-looking, me or this guy?</i>

531
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,929
<i>Patrick, let's focus, buddy.</i>

532
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,849
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

533
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,476
<i>The one with the potatoes?</i>

534
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,188
<i>That girl?</i>

535
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,857
<i>Yeah, that's this guy's girl.</i>

536
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,526
<i>Right, was.</i>

537
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,612
<i>We took care of that.</i>

538
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,701
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

539
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,370
What? You little fuck.

540
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,454
What?

541
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,623
She was unconscious, man.

542
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,876
She was beautiful.

543
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,130
I stole a pair of her panties,
as well.

544
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,301
Jesus!

545
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,095
What? It's not like... I mean,
they were clean and all.

546
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,514
Don't tell me this. I don't
want to hear this shit.

547
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,225
<i>- They were clean.
- What? Don't. Stop.</i>

548
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,978
<i>Okay, all right.
We've got work to do.</i>

549
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,980
<i>Hold my papers.</i>

550
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,165
There's more.

551
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,714
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

552
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,384
<i>What?</i>

553
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,636
Jesus.

554
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,185
...how unethical...

555
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,021
It's not really that bad.

556
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,274
Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

557
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,110
<i>Patrick,
you stole a girl's panties.</i>

558
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,208
There's someone here.

559
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,586
He stole your underwear.

560
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,880
I don't see anyone.

561
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,235
Joel, where are my boots?

562
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,904
<i>Now, why
are you showing me poisons?</i>

563
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,906
<i>Can't you understand English?</i>

564
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,283
<i>Potions, I said. Potions.</i>

565
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,251
<i>Love potion, please.</i>

566
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,754
I'm fucking
crawling out of my skin!

567
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,176
I should have left you
at the flea market.

568
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,774
Want to go?

569
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,652
I want to have a baby.

570
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,156
Let's talk about it later.

571
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,783
No. I want to have a baby.

572
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,412
I don't think we're ready.

573
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,040
You're not ready.

574
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,335
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

575
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,337
What?

576
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,507
I don't want to
talk about it here.

577
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
I can't hear you.

578
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,053
I can never the fuck
understand what you're saying.

579
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,929
I said I don't want to
talk about this!

580
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,223
We're fucking gonna
talk about it!

581
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,685
You can't just say that and
say you don't wanna talk about it.

582
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,896
I'm sorry. I'd make a
fucking good mother.

583
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,397
I love children.

584
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,942
I'm creative, I'm smart, and
I'd make a fucking great mother!

585
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,319
It's you, Joel.

586
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,779
It's you who can't
commit to anything.

587
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:53,988
It's going.

588
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,074
You've no idea how lucky
you are I'm interested in you.

589
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,494
I don't even know why I am.
Maybe I should end it right here!

590
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,414
Leave you at the flea market
with the stupid costume jewelry!

591
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,959
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair to die in!

592
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,429
Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary, how's it going?

593
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,139
Hey, you.
It's freezing outside.

594
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,432
Did you find us okay?

595
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,517
Yeah.

596
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,564
Hot.

597
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,651
Poor guy.

598
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,781
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

599
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,408
We haven't checked yet.

600
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,579
Let me do the honors.

601
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,999
Mary hates me.

602
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,710
Never really had
much luck with the ladies.

603
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,338
Maybe if you stopped
stealing their panties.

604
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,384
There's more.
No.

605
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,718
Yes.
No.

606
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,642
You didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

607
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,853
No, I don't know.
That's okay.

608
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,605
Wait.
"Blessed are the forgetful,

609
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,608
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

610
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,787
That's Nietzsche.

611
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,790
<i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i>
I found it in my <i>Bartlett's.</i>

612
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,710
What's your <i>Bartlett's?</i>

613
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,670
It's a quote book, Patrick.

614
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,881
It's a book of quotations.

615
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,508
I think Howard will be
in <i>Bartlett's</i> one day.

616
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,302
Definitely.
Howard is pure <i>Bartlett's.</i>

617
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,141
Can you wake him up?

618
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,517
You can't wake him up.

619
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,737
You don't tell me things,
Joel.

620
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,240
I'm an open book.

621
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,243
I tell you everything.

622
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,455
Every damn embarrassing thing.

623
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,293
You don't trust me.

624
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,088
Constantly talking isn't
necessarily communicating.

625
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,468
I don't do that.

626
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,097
I want to know you.

627
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,062
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus.

628
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,816
People have to share things,
Joel.

629
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,278
That's what intimacy is.

630
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,615
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

631
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,033
I'm sorry.

632
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,662
My life just isn't
that interesting.

633
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,832
<i>I wanna read some of those
journals you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

634
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:56,462
<i>What do you write if you don't have
any thoughts or passions or love?</i>

635
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,848
<i>"November 19, 2003.</i>

636
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,935
<i>"Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

637
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,898
<i>"Are we like
those poor couples</i>

638
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,485
<i>"you feel sorry for
in restaurants?</i>

639
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,696
<i>"Are we the dining dead?"</i>

640
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:26,575
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

641
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,331
I like that.

642
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,086
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,879
Good.

644
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,050
More?
No, thank you.

645
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,723
<i>She's going to be drunk
and stupid now.</i>

646
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,893
Would you do me a favor and
clean the goddamn hair off the soap

647
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,520
when you're done
in the shower?

648
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,314
It's really...
Yeah.

649
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,357
It's gross.
Gross.

650
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,154
I think it's just...
Repulsive.

651
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,864
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,080
Patrick,
can we get through this?

653
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,833
<i>Hey, Tangerine.</i>

654
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,086
<i>Patrick, it's you.</i>

655
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,465
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

656
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,675
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

657
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,012
<i>I don't know. I'm just
confused about everything.</i>

658
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,264
<i>Confused?</i>

659
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,434
<i>What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.</i>

660
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,777
<i>Do you love me?</i>

661
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,236
<i>Of course I do.</i>

662
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,155
Where's
the self-help section?

663
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,699
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

664
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,493
<i>No. You're beautiful.</i>

665
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,455
<i>Maybe I should come over.
No. I don't know.</i>

666
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,624
<i>I'm a mess, Patrick.</i>

667
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,294
<i>Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.</i>

668
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,504
<i>Okay.</i>

669
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,799
Can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

670
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,219
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

671
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,721
Let him go, Stan.
I'll help.

672
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,933
See?
How hard can it be?

673
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,643
She hates me.
She wants me to go.

674
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,894
Go.

675
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,481
All right. I'll be right
over, Tangerine.

676
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,982
You like?

677
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,072
I matched
my sweatshirt exactly.

678
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,407
I like it.
You do?

679
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,242
You look like a tangerine.

680
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,495
Clementine the tangerine.

681
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,705
Juicy and seedless.

682
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:37,873
I like that.

683
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,919
I like tangerines.

684
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,088
Can you see me
doing ducks?

685
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,214
Tangerine.

686
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,759
How does he know
to call you that?

687
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,261
How did who know?

688
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,930
Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.

689
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,515
That's what
they called themselves.

690
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,184
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

691
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,562
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

692
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,689
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice.

693
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,315
Yeah,
it's totally incredible.

694
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,693
What Howard
gives to the world.

695
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,446
Yeah.

696
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,198
To let people begin again.

697
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,660
It's beautiful.

698
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,122
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free

699
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,499
and so clean.

700
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,794
Adults are this
mess of sadness

701
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,214
and phobias.

702
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,508
And Howard
just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,648
Baby, what's going on?

704
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,484
I don't know.

705
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,237
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

706
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,157
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!

707
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,492
Nothing makes
any sense to me!

708
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,910
You're not getting old.

709
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,163
Nothing makes any sense.

710
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,664
Tangerine.

711
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,377
It's okay.

712
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,297
Let's go out dancing.

713
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,716
You want to go out
to Montauk with me?

714
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,051
Montauk?

715
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,011
No, come up
to Boston with me.

716
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,888
Sure. We can go next weekend.

717
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,517
No, now. I have to go now.

718
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,602
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

719
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,149
<i>Hi, it's Joel.</i>

720
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:33,531
<i>Leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

721
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,201
<i>Pick up.</i>

722
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,875
Hello? What's up?

723
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,795
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

724
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,923
Can you handle things tonight
alone? I'm really sorry.

725
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,717
Don't worry about it.
I've got it under control.

726
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,886
He's pretty much
on auto-pilot now, anyway.

727
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,555
<i>Thanks.
I owe you big-time.</i>

728
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,056
Dude, I got to go.

729
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,656
"Look. You and me
on the Charles River.

730
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,701
"I could die right now, Clem.
I'm just happy.

731
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,413
"I've never felt that before.
I'm exactly where I want..."

732
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,332
I'm so excited.

733
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,875
I'm excited, too.

734
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,127
Cool.

735
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,842
I got you this thing.

736
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,471
Happy early Valentine's Day.
Thank you.

737
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,602
What is it?

738
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,103
I don't know. Open it up.

739
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,487
It's gorgeous.

740
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:58,157
You like it?
It's just my taste, really.

741
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:02,578
God, I've never gone out with a
guy who bought me jewelry I liked.

742
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:04,997
Thank you.

743
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,256
Let's go.
Okay.

744
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,551
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?

745
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,554
Am I ugly?

746
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,351
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

747
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,480
Can't believe
I'm crying already.

748
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,732
Sometimes I think

749
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,985
people don't understand
how lonely it is to be a kid.

750
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,988
Like you don't matter.

751
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,784
So, I'm eight,

752
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,245
and I have these toys,
these dolls.

753
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:50,417
My favorite is this ugly girl
doll who I call Clementine.

754
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,253
And I keep yelling at her,

755
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,173
"You can't be ugly.
Be pretty."

756
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,761
It's weird.
Like if I can transform her,

757
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,890
I would magically
change, too.

758
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,939
You're pretty.

759
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,234
Don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,610
You're pretty.

761
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,075
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

762
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,410
Just this one.

763
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,871
I don't want
to hold your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,001
Stop it!

765
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,464
I could die right now.

766
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,971
I'm just so happy.

767
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,601
I've never felt
that before.

768
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,648
I'm just exactly

769
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,403
where I want to be.

770
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,458
I want to call it off.
I'll give you a sign.

771
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,132
I want to call it off.

772
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:26,221
Can you hear me? I don't want
this anymore! I want to call it off!

773
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,856
Is anybody there?

774
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,292
What?
We've got to go.

775
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,420
Where? I have an
idea of how to stop this.

776
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,755
Stop what?

777
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,471
<i>Don't tickle me. No.</i>

778
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,389
<i>Smell my pits!</i>

779
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,059
Concentrate, Clem.

780
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,562
<i>- We have to get back to the
office. - Halloween.</i>

781
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,398
<i>There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.</i>

782
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,153
Back here. Come on.

783
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,782
<i>Look at me.
I want to go there.</i>

784
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:31,328
<i>Our files are
confidential, so I can't show you evidence.</i>

785
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:35,541
<i>Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski</i>

786
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:39,086
<i>was not happy
and she wanted to move on.</i>

787
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:41,880
<i>Tell me about...</i>

788
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,050
<i>Tell me everything you
remember. That's what he said.</i>

789
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,094
<i>What did we
see that day?</i>

790
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,973
We're going to see
my grandma. Shit!

791
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,559
<i>CLEMENTINE: Joel, why... JOEL:
No. We're not going on a train.</i>

792
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,811
<i>Joel, please.
Don't make me run anymore.</i>

793
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,187
<i>Come on.</i>

794
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,272
<i>Mierzwiak!</i>

795
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,567
<i>Do we always have to run?</i>

796
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,453
Please?

797
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:19,251
Why don't we begin by you telling
me everything you can remember...

798
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,129
Mierzwiak,
wake me up!

799
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:28,218
I'm sorry, Mr. Barish, I thought
you understood what was going on.

800
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,890
You're erasing her from me.
You're erasing me from her.

801
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,773
You got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

802
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,151
I'm in my brain.

803
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,571
I'm part of
your imagination, too.

804
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,532
How can I help
you from there?

805
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,493
I'm inside your head, too.
I'm you.

806
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,706
Sorry.

807
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,374
Look, who's that?

808
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,210
He works for us.

809
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:06,673
That's Patrick,

810
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,800
baby boy.

811
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:13,013
He's stealing my identity.
He stole my stuff.

812
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,935
He's seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

813
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,937
He stole her underwear.

814
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,357
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.

815
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,318
I could die right now, Clem.

816
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,861
I'm just happy.

817
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,198
I've never felt that before.

818
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,283
I'm exactly
where I want to be.

819
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,412
I want to go home.

820
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,666
What?

821
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,006
Wait, Clem.

822
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:53,053
Clem, they're erasing you.

823
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,764
Over here!

824
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,975
Clem, focus.

825
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,978
I hired them, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.

826
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,064
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

827
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,734
I need it to stop before I wake
up and don't know you anymore.

828
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,073
Just tell them
to cancel it then.

829
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,283
What the hell are you
talking about?

830
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,077
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.

831
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,329
Wake yourself up!

832
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,498
Okay, you want me to wake up?
All right.

833
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,959
Okay, here we go. Will
it make you happy if I try?

834
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,669
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.

835
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,213
Here we go.
That was a great idea.

836
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,135
That's working
like gangbusters.

837
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,263
Don't!
That tickles me!

838
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,392
What the hell is that?
It's a birthmark!

839
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,605
It did work, for a second.

840
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,525
But I couldn't...
See?

841
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,152
I couldn't move.

842
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,364
Isn't that just another one of
Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

843
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,992
It's more important to prove
me wrong than to actually...

844
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,995
I don't want to discuss this
right now, okay?

845
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,204
Fine.

846
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,501
Then what? I'm listening.

847
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,712
I don't know.
You erased me.

848
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,381
That's why I'm here
and doing this.

849
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:15,302
I'm sorry.
You know me, I'm impulsive.

850
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,808
That's what I love about you.

851
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,484
I have
another idea for this problem.

852
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,402
This is a memory of me.

853
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,905
The way you wanted
to have sex on the couch

854
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,365
after you look down
at my crotch.

855
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,869
The eraser guys are coming,

856
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,288
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

857
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,082
somewhere where
I don't belong,

858
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,958
and we hide there
till morning?

859
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,259
I can't remember anything
without you.

860
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,180
That's very sweet,
but try, okay? Okay.

861
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:12,859
<i>Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream</i>

862
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,447
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily Life is but a dream</i>

863
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:29,501
It's working.
I'm a genius.

864
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,239
Where did you go?

865
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,825
I'm supposed to come, too!

866
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,451
I'm just gonna go
get a salad bowl.

867
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,245
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

868
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,872
He likes to be near me.

869
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,707
Absolutely.

870
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,878
It worked.
My God, look at this.

871
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,630
It worked!

872
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,841
Look at this dress, man.

873
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,802
I wish I could
take it with me.

874
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,473
Who am I?
Mrs. Hamlyn.

875
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,725
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

876
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,477
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

877
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,106
Found the salad bowl. I'm
serving salad and string beans.

878
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,026
Is he okay under there?
Honey, are you all right?

879
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,320
I feel like
I could clean up all day.

880
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,239
Would you hate me if I asked
you to clean some string beans?

881
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:44,451
No, not at all.
God, I love this kitchen.

882
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,453
Thank you so much.

883
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,414
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.

884
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,628
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

885
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,379
Oh, baby Joel.

886
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,633
Ls every
little peanut under there okay?

887
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,009
He's fine.

888
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,802
Do you have
something to drink?

889
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,347
How about
a cocktail? I know it's not 5:00...

890
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,556
I would die for a vodka.

891
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,141
Let me check
if I have that.

892
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,976
Okay, I'm just going
to wait right here.

893
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,063
No, sweetie. Joely?

894
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,316
Your mother wants me to mind
you. Get back under the table.

895
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,442
Ice cream.

896
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:21,238
No, not until
after you've had your dinner.

897
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,908
Come on ! Grow up.

898
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,576
Don't leave
me, Clem. Oh, my God.

899
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,079
No, I'm right here.
This is sort of warped.

900
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,748
I'm scared.
I want my mommy.

901
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:35,001
Don't cry, baby Joel.
It's okay.

902
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:41,216
Joel, stop it! I think it's working.
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

903
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,968
Honey, look.

904
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,220
Wait there.

905
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,602
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

906
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,853
Yuck.

907
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,568
It stopped.
What?

908
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,405
It stopped erasing.

909
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,534
Oh, shit!
This is terrible.

910
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,330
He's off the map.

911
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:15,875
Where?
I don't know where.

912
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,963
This is very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

913
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:25,885
Crap! What did we do?
What do I do?

914
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,471
What shall we do? STAN:
I don't know what to do.

915
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,808
What shall we do?
I just said, I don't know.

916
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,476
I'm sorry.
What shall we do?

917
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,771
I don't know. Mellow out.
You're freaking me out.

918
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:40,900
We have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

919
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:45,238
Quiet. You're freaking me
out. All gooey and half-baked.

920
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,950
That sounds so good.
I'm hungry.

921
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,661
Oh, shit. What?

922
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,789
We should call Howard.

923
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:58,668
No way. No sir, man. This
is my... I can handle this.

924
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,628
You can't call Howard.

925
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,007
There's no time
to fuck around.

926
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,343
I've got this under control.
What are you talking about?

927
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,552
Stop fucking around.

928
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,803
Okay. I'll call Howard.

929
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:17,979
Hello?

930
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:22,400
Howard, it's Stan. I'm
working on this guy down here.

931
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,110
We've lost him
for a moment,

932
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,364
and I can't
bring him back up.

933
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,992
Okay, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

934
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:34,371
I wasn't sure because I was
away from the monitor for a minute,

935
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:38,249
and I had it on auto-pilot
because I had to pee.

936
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,001
<i>Where was Patrick?</i>

937
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,670
He had to go home sick.

938
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,716
What's the address?

939
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,842
<i>I know,
I'm so sorry.</i>

940
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,094
That's okay. Come on.

941
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,346
<i>We're at 159 South Village.</i>

942
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,474
<i>Apartment 1-E.
Rockville Center.</i>

943
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,768
Mary, he's coming right now.

944
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:57,977
I'm staying.

945
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,147
Get your stuff, Mary.

946
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,982
I think you should go.

947
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,359
No.

948
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,572
I am so stoned.

949
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,742
Please, Mary,
you have to go.

950
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,204
Stop being stoned. I don't
want him to see me stoned.

951
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:21,251
You have no idea how much
trouble I'll get into if Howard comes...

952
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:24,421
Joel, stop. Look.

953
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,848
I want her to pick me up.
Weird how strong that desire is.

954
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,101
Joel, look at me. You'll
remember me in the morning,

955
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:42,021
you'll come to me, you'll tell
me about us, and we'll start over.

956
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,568
Pat? I thought we could
have a little cocktail.

957
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,362
That Patrick guy,
he's copying me.

958
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,905
What Patrick guy?

959
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,782
That guy.
What?

960
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,909
He's here, in my apartment.

961
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,204
One of the eraser guys. He fell
for you when they were doing you,

962
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:02,250
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

963
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,836
and you guys are dating.
Really?

964
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:06,963
Is he cute?

965
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,593
There's nothing wrong
with you.

966
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,721
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

967
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,892
You're kind, beautiful,

968
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:24,314
smart, funny, and nice.

969
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,483
What?

970
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,736
Okay, all right.

971
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,035
Move. Come on,
let's go. Careful.

972
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,747
I'm still stoned.

973
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,792
Those eye drops
you gave me didn't do shit.

974
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,840
Be cool.

975
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,430
Hello, Mary,
what are you doing here?

976
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,224
Hi, Howard. She
was just here to help out.

977
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,560
I wanted to understand as much
about the procedure as possible.

978
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,981
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings

979
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,691
of the work that we do.

980
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:12,070
Not that I do,
but the work that is done

981
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,030
by people where I also work.

982
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,657
The work of my colleagues.

983
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:20,662
Let's see if we can get to
the bottom of this, shall we?

984
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,377
That's odd.

985
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,920
I already tried that.

986
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,213
You tried going through
the C-gate?

987
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,131
Of course.

988
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,425
I mean, yes.

989
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,473
All right.

990
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,144
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

991
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:51,067
I ran the utility programs,
and I had nothing there,

992
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,612
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

993
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,907
Here, Howard, I got
you a chair. Thank you.

994
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,159
There you go.
You're welcome.

995
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,662
All right.
I've got it.

996
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,498
I'll go through
the entire memory,

997
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,833
see if something
comes up.

998
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,301
I love being bathed
in the sink.

999
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,386
Such a feeling of security.

1000
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,848
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1001
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,183
There it is.

1002
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,770
I don't understand why
it's off the map like that.

1003
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,316
What the heck
was he doing there?

1004
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,951
His eyes are open.

1005
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,248
Has this happened
before with him? No.

1006
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,710
This is not good.

1007
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,591
I'm going to have
to give him this.

1008
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,284
<i>Can't
you see I love you, Antoine?</i>

1009
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,912
Okay, we're back in.

1010
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:33,086
That was beautiful to watch, Howard,
like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

1011
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,090
Thank you, Mary.

1012
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,094
Howard, you should get some
sleep. I think I'll be fine now.

1013
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,806
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1014
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,060
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1015
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,943
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.

1016
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,488
Yes, I know, but how can a woman
love a man with a name like Wally?

1017
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,157
What was that?

1018
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,868
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1019
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,203
There is?

1020
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,707
Got it.

1021
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,919
Tangerine! Come on.
We've got to go.

1022
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,213
Go on. Please go.

1023
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,468
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1024
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,387
Clem, come on!

1025
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,389
<i>There I am.</i>

1026
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,517
That truck.

1027
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,311
Doc? Please!

1028
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:38,693
<i>Let's begin by you telling me
everything you remember...</i>

1029
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,905
That's strange. He's in a
memory that we've already erased.

1030
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,910
At least we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1031
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,412
Come on, Clem.

1032
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,206
<i>He's developed some
sort of resistance to the procedure.</i>

1033
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,125
I don't want to run anymore.

1034
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,668
Shit.

1035
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,463
Come on.

1036
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,923
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1037
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,676
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1038
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,803
Humiliation.

1039
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,764
<i>Come on, you big baby.</i>

1040
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,356
No!

1041
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,902
Bye, Howard.
Wait.

1042
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,863
He's disappeared again.

1043
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,448
Oh, dear.

1044
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,618
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1045
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,578
Humiliation.

1046
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,880
I don't like it, either. I'm trying
to find horrible secret places to...

1047
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,965
Honey, I have a surprise.

1048
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,928
You know what? I'll just
ask you in the morning.

1049
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,013
Good night.

1050
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,228
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

1051
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:57,980
Look.

1052
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,236
Joel, look where we are.

1053
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,658
This isn't good.

1054
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,411
Then hide me somewhere
really buried.

1055
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,540
Hit it, Joel!

1056
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:19,919
I can't, I've got
to go home. I'll do it later!

1057
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,357
He has a girlfriend.

1058
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,403
Wait, what am I doing? Freddy,
you don't scare me anymore.

1059
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,867
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.

1060
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,035
They're not worth it, Joel.

1061
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,080
He's not listening !
Come on.

1062
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,582
Stupid!

1063
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,882
<i>I'm so ashamed.</i>

1064
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:10,553
<i>It's okay.
You were a little kid. Come on.</i>

1065
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,638
<i>That's where I live, lived.</i>

1066
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,765
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

1067
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,310
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.</i>

1068
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,687
<i>You can really kill me
this time. It's my turn. Go.</i>

1069
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,315
<i>You're really going to die,
though, okay?</i>

1070
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,733
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1071
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,067
<i>You're dead.</i>

1072
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,029
<i>My mom.</i>

1073
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,407
<i>It's okay, we're playing.
It's not real.</i>

1074
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,658
<i>He's killing me.</i>

1075
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,745
<i>Are you dead yet?
You're dead!</i>

1076
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,082
I think I got the hang of
this. I still don't understand it,

1077
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,168
but I'm finding him
quickly enough.

1078
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,457
Are you okay?

1079
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:29,715
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
Almost three seconds.

1080
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:31,425
Let's do it one more time.

1081
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,052
One more
and then I get to go.

1082
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,859
This is so cool!

1083
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,778
Look out!

1084
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,242
It's fluff.

1085
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,995
Our house.

1086
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,210
Wait, we've got to go.

1087
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,964
Come on.

1088
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,266
This is a really bad time
for this.

1089
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,311
I don't even know
where we're going.

1090
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,856
It's going to be fun.
It's the best place.

1091
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,734
No, this way.
This way. Come on.

1092
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,445
You're no help at all.

1093
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,614
Come on.

1094
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,075
Let go of me, Joel.

1095
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,549
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1096
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:02,266
I guess I'll go out
for some air,

1097
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,143
if nobody minds.

1098
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,897
It looks like you have
everything under control here.

1099
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,941
Yeah, that's fine.

1100
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,371
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1101
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,208
What do you mean?

1102
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,460
Like famous quotes.

1103
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,713
I find reading them
inspirational,

1104
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:37,676
and in my reading, I've come across
some I thought you might like, too.

1105
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,304
I'd love to hear some.

1106
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:43,432
There's one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful,

1107
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,435
"for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1108
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,270
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.

1109
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,648
I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1110
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,693
No, it's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1111
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,072
There's this
other one I like.

1112
01:16:58,155 --> 01:16:59,865
It's by Pope Alexander
and it goes...

1113
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,243
Alexander Pope?

1114
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,203
Oh, yeah. Shit.

1115
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:08,374
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"

1116
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,001
and sound like a dope, and
then I go ahead and say it.

1117
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:14,046
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1118
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:20,136
The quote goes, "How happy
is the blameless vestal's lot!

1119
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,431
<i>"The world forgetting
by the world forgot</i>

1120
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,977
<i>"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind!</i>

1121
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,815
<i>"Each pray'r accepted
and each wish resign'd"</i>

1122
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:37,319
I want to be a great,
big, huge elephant.

1123
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,573
With a huge trunk like that.

1124
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,538
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1125
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,541
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1126
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,882
I really admire
the work you do.

1127
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,551
I don't mean to be
so familiar...

1128
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,721
It's fine.
I'm happy to hear...

1129
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,478
I'm sorry.

1130
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,985
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1131
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,448
I shouldn't have said that.

1132
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,534
Mary, you're
a wonderful girl.

1133
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,789
But, you know,
I have a wife and kids.

1134
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:39,048
Mary, we can't do this.

1135
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,858
Good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1136
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,536
- What? Who is it?
- Oh, my God.

1137
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,427
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1138
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,893
Hollis!

1139
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:37,481
Wait.

1140
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,859
I knew it, Howard.

1141
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,320
It didn't start out like this.
I came here to work.

1142
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,614
This is a one-time mistake.

1143
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,783
I'm a stupid girl
with a crush.

1144
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,202
I basically
forced him into it.

1145
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,039
Don't be a monster.
Tell the girl.

1146
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,627
Tell me what?

1147
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,879
Oh, you poor kid.

1148
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,801
You can have him.
You did.

1149
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,896
What?

1150
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:29,867
We have a history.

1151
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,997
I'm sorry.
You wanted the procedure.

1152
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:41,587
You wanted it done
so you could get past...

1153
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,724
I have to finish the work in
there. It's almost morning.

1154
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:59,355
We'll talk later, okay?

1155
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,042
Let me give you a lift home.

1156
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:39,103
Didn't figure you'd show
your face around me again.

1157
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,981
I thought you were humiliated.

1158
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,900
You did run away,
after all.

1159
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,403
I just needed to see you.

1160
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:48,570
Yeah?

1161
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:51,865
I'd like to

1162
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,743
take you out or something.

1163
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,663
You're married.

1164
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,624
Not yet. Not married.

1165
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,293
No, I'm not married.

1166
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,005
Look, I'm telling you right off
the bat, I'm high maintenance,

1167
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,759
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage

1168
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,095
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1169
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,014
If you want to be with me,
you're with me.

1170
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:17,599
Okay.

1171
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:21,770
Too many guys think I'm a
concept, or I complete them

1172
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,148
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1173
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:28,277
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1174
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,736
Don't assign me yours.

1175
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,114
I remember that speech
really well.

1176
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,700
I had you pegged,
didn't I?

1177
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,743
Had the whole human race
pegged.

1178
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,745
Probably.

1179
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,875
I still thought you were
going to save my life.

1180
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,209
Even after that.

1181
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,713
I know.

1182
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,593
It would be different,

1183
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,680
if we could just
give it another go-round.

1184
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,854
Remember me.
Try your best.

1185
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,859
Maybe we can.

1186
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,435
<i>Just
tell me what you remember,</i>

1187
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,145
<i>and we'll take it
from there.</i>

1188
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,484
<i>I liked you immediately.</i>

1189
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,863
<i>You didn't come on to me
at all. I liked that.</i>

1190
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,868
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first,</i>

1191
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,579
<i>but I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1192
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,208
<i>I couldn't wait
to come to work.</i>

1193
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:10,796
<i>I had these fantasies of us
being married and having kids...</i>

1194
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,300
<i>Howie, I can't do this.</i>

1195
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,220
<i>We agreed
it's for the best, Mary.</i>

1196
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,555
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1197
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:22,808
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1198
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,561
I'll take the bottom
and you...

1199
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,604
No, Joel,
help me with that.

1200
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:28,814
Will you get the cooler?

1201
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,566
Honey, the cooler's pretty...

1202
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,942
She can get it.

1203
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,611
Let me get that.
No, no, no.

1204
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:35,737
Don't take anything.

1205
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:36,947
I can take the plane.

1206
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,366
Put the gate back up.

1207
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,538
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

1208
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:48,250
<i>You were by the surf. I could
just make you out in the distance.</i>

1209
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,919
<i>I remember being drawn to you,
even then.</i>

1210
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,171
<i>I thought,
"Wow, how odd!</i>

1211
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,257
<i>"I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1212
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,593
<i>You were
in that orange sweatshirt</i>

1213
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:01,305
<i>that I would come to know so
well, and even hate, eventually.</i>

1214
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,934
But at the time I thought, "How
cool, an orange sweatshirt."

1215
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,352
Hi, there.

1216
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,731
Hi.

1217
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,526
I saw you sitting over here
by yourself,

1218
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:18,488
and I thought,
"Thank God,

1219
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:22,284
"someone normal who doesn't
know how to interact at these things."

1220
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,455
I don't ever know
what to say.

1221
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,624
I'm Clementine.

1222
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,669
Can I borrow
a piece of your chicken?

1223
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:36,757
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

1224
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:45,140
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

1225
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:49,061
I'm Joel.

1226
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:53,857
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.

1227
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:56,568
You mean, like

1228
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:59,321
<i>"Oh, my darlin</i>', <i>Clementine?"</i>

1229
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,366
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

1230
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:04,660
Yeah, like that.

1231
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,286
No, no jokes.

1232
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,747
One of my favorite things
when I was a kid

1233
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,083
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1234
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,755
I think your name is magical.

1235
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:23,261
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.

1236
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,349
I know.

1237
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,268
What do we do?

1238
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,481
Enjoy it.

1239
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,959
- You married?
- No.

1240
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,461
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1241
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,089
I do sort of live
with someone, though.

1242
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,049
Male or female?

1243
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,635
What? Female.

1244
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,225
At least I'm not barking up
the wrong tree.

1245
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,397
Do you know these people?

1246
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,982
No, of course not.
Come on.

1247
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,902
They might have a dog.

1248
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,320
There's no dog.

1249
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,324
What are you doing?

1250
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,826
It's freezing out.

1251
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,579
I don't believe this.

1252
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,177
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1253
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,347
Nobody's coming here tonight,
believe me.

1254
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:57,522
So, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1255
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,067
Naomi,
but we're not really...

1256
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,155
Whatever.
So this is great.

1257
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:10,118
Now I can look for candles,
matches, and the liquor cabinet.

1258
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:11,536
Oh, God.

1259
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,669
I think we should go.

1260
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,546
There's no phone line.

1261
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,799
What?
I think we should go.

1262
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:27,552
Why? It's our house.
Just for tonight.

1263
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:30,764
We are
David and Ruth Laskin.

1264
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,975
Which one do you want to be?

1265
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:37,270
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1266
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,066
What do you need?

1267
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,027
Alcohol.

1268
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,531
So, are you okay with wine?

1269
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,740
I don't know.

1270
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,450
Well, you choose the wine.

1271
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:54,496
I'll go find the bedroom and
slip into something more Ruth.

1272
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,919
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- We really should go.

1273
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,257
I've got to catch my ride.

1274
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,885
So go.

1275
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:13,932
I did. I thought
maybe you were a nut.

1276
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,977
But you were exciting.

1277
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,981
I wish you'd stayed.

1278
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,025
I wish I'd stayed, too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1279
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,444
I wish I'd done
a lot of things.

1280
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:36,288
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1281
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:38,874
I came back
downstairs and you were gone.

1282
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:41,751
I walked out the door.
Why?

1283
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:44,963
I don't know. I felt
like a scared little kid.

1284
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,299
It was above my head.

1285
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:50,051
You were scared?
Yeah.

1286
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,764
I thought
you knew that about me.

1287
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,019
<i>I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation.</i>

1288
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,814
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1289
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:09,487
You said "So go"
with such disdain.

1290
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,407
I'm sorry.

1291
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:13,575
It's okay.

1292
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,002
What if you stayed this time?

1293
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,006
I walked out the door.

1294
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:30,634
There's no memory left.

1295
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,303
Come back
and make up a goodbye.

1296
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:35,847
Let's pretend
we had one.

1297
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,777
Bye, Joel.

1298
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,696
I love you.

1299
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,492
Meet me in Montauk.

1300
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:03,166
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.

1301
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:08,630
<i>You were operating the plane
with the remote control, and it crashed.</i>

1302
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,423
<i>It was fucking windy.
Come on.</i>

1303
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,759
<i>You're stoned
and you're driving.</i>

1304
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:16,304
<i>The pot balances it out and brings
you back up. That's why I smoke it.</i>

1305
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:19,099
<i>If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.</i>

1306
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:24,062
<i>It does. A medical test was done.
It's proven on the Science Network.</i>

1307
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,814
<i>Honey, just watch the road.</i>

1308
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,232
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

1309
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,028
I saw you talking
to a pretty girl.

1310
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,196
She was nice.

1311
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,156
Yeah, man, who was it?

1312
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:40,453
She was just a girl.

1313
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:49,462
Okay.

1314
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:29,002
So I've got to
drop the van off.

1315
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:32,213
Thanks, Stan. We'll talk.

1316
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:00,385
You've got all your stuff,
I see.

1317
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,511
That's right.

1318
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:03,471
I take it
you're not coming back.

1319
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,932
I wouldn't come back
if I was you.

1320
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,226
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.

1321
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,104
So you didn't do
the erasing?

1322
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:12,856
Of course not. God, no.

1323
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,567
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1324
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,652
Once, maybe.

1325
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,907
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car,

1326
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:25,160
and I saw you two talking.

1327
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,204
So I waved to you,
and you giggled.

1328
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,456
How did I look?

1329
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,419
You looked happy.

1330
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,422
Happy with a secret.

1331
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,341
And after that?

1332
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:42,719
I never saw you two together
again like that,

1333
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:46,389
so I just figured
I was imagining things.

1334
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:16,878
I really like you, Mary Svevo.
You know that?

1335
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,641
Thanks.

1336
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,636
Let me get my toothbrush.

1340
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:34,789

last night.

1344
01:37:02,108 --> 01:37:03,234
Nice?

1345
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:07,989
I had the best fucking night of
my entire fucking life last night.

1346
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,907
That's better.

1347
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,371

You clearly are!

get the fuck away from me!

Nice to see you.

<i>The truth is,
I was embarrassed in public,</i>

Hi. <i>because she would
pronounce "library, " "li-berry."</i>

01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,750
Look what I found.

1381
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:09,754
<i>I think if there's a truly
seductive quality about Clementine,</i>

1382
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:13,591
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

1383
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:17,553
Made me look skinny.

1384
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:21,390
<i>An amazing, burning meteorite
will carry you to another world</i>

1385
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:23,392
<i>where things are exciting.</i>

1386
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:29,982
<i>But what you quickly learn is
that it's really an elaborate ruse.</i>

1387
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,652
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1388
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,279
It's okay.

1389
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:43,496
I really like you. I hate that I
said mean things about you.

1390
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:45,623
Let me turn this off, okay?

1391
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,209
That's only fair.

1392
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:54,882
<i>The whole thing
with the hair, it's all bullshit.</i>

1393
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,218
I really like your hair.

1394
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,511
Thank you.

1395
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,179
I do.

1396
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:05,393
You want a drink or something?

1397
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,144
Do you have any whiskey?

1398
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:13,484
<i>I didn't think
her sex was motivated.</i>

1399
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,738
<i>I saw it clearly the last night
we were together. It wasn't sexy.</i>

1400
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,241
<i>It was just sad.</i>

1401
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,578
Sorry,
I thought there was more.

1402
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,998
<i>The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her</i>

1403
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,791
<i>is to fuck them.</i>

1404
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:33,879
<i>Or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of them.</i>

1405
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:37,425
<i>I think she's
so desperate and insecure</i>

1406
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:41,679
<i>that she'll sooner or later
go around fucking everybody.</i>

1407
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:42,888
I don't do that.

1408
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:45,391
I wouldn't
think that about you.

1409
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,643
Because I don't.
I know.

1410
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,730
It hurts me that you said
that, because I don't do that.

1411
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:52,523
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.

1412
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:56,360
I'm going to go.
I'm a little confused.

1413
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:59,196
I don't really think
I can be here.

1414
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:07,163
Bye.

1415
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,957
<i>I really thought
I knew her so well.</i>

1416
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:12,043
It was nice meeting you
and all.

1417
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:18,215
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

1418
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,926
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1419
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:26,932
Wait.

1420
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,063
What?
I don't know. Just wait.

1421
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:36,942
What do you want, Joel? I
want you to wait for a while.

1422
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,542
Okay.
Really?

1423
01:42:54,335 --> 01:42:58,255
I'm not a concept, just a fucked-up
girl looking for my peace of mind.

1424
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,840
I'm not perfect.

1425
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,385
I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1426
01:43:02,468 --> 01:43:04,845
But you will.
Right now I can't.

1427
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,972
You will think of things.

1428
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:08,933
And I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped,

1429
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:11,435
because that's what happens
with me.

1430
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:13,979
Okay.

1431
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:19,610
Okay.

1432
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,449
Okay.
