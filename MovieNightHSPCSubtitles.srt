Merry Christmas.

1426
01:44:59,387 --> 01:45:02,151
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants.

1427
01:45:02,256 --> 01:45:04,417
The mayor will
have my ass.

1428
01:45:11,099 --> 01:45:12,498
Woo!

1429
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,075
What will we do now?

1430
01:45:28,182 --> 01:45:31,015
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1431
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:33,019
We've shut them down.

1432
01:45:33,121 --> 01:45:34,520
We let them sweat,

1433
01:45:34,622 --> 01:45:36,556
then give them
helicopters.

1434
01:45:36,658 --> 01:45:38,523
Right up the ass.

1435
01:45:40,628 --> 01:45:44,462
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.

1436
01:45:44,565 --> 01:45:47,466
I want air support
ready in five minutes.

1437
01:45:47,568 --> 01:45:49,331
Damn right.
Fully armed.

1438
01:45:49,437 --> 01:45:51,302
We're on the way.

1439
01:45:58,079 --> 01:45:59,171
Yeah!

1440
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,182
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1441
01:46:05,586 --> 01:46:08,054
This is
Special Agent Johnson.

1442
01:46:08,156 --> 01:46:10,056
The State Department
has arranged...

1443
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:12,592
for the return
of your comrades.

1444
01:46:12,694 --> 01:46:15,492
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1445
01:46:15,596 --> 01:46:16,995
We'll be ready.

1446
01:46:17,098 --> 01:46:18,497
When he realizes
what hit him,

1447
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:20,123
he'll be dead.

1448
01:46:20,234 --> 01:46:23,135
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1449
01:46:23,237 --> 01:46:25,137
By the time
they figure out...

1450
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:26,638
what went wrong,

1451
01:46:26,741 --> 01:46:28,675
we'll be sitting
on a beach...

1452
01:46:28,776 --> 01:46:30,038
earning 20%.

1453
01:46:34,615 --> 01:46:36,515
Ah!Jeez!

1454
01:46:36,617 --> 01:46:40,246
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1455
01:46:41,956 --> 01:46:43,685
I'm here, John.

1456
01:46:45,393 --> 01:46:48,794
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1457
01:46:48,896 --> 01:46:51,797
I want you to do
something for me.

1458
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:53,457
Um...

1459
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,469
I want you
to find my wife.

1460
01:46:56,571 --> 01:46:58,471
Don't ask me how.

1461
01:46:58,573 --> 01:47:01,474
I want you
to tell her something.

1462
01:47:01,576 --> 01:47:04,477
I want you
to tell her that...

1463
01:47:04,579 --> 01:47:05,978
Um...

1464
01:47:07,582 --> 01:47:08,981
Mmm...

1465
01:47:11,085 --> 01:47:14,987
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1466
01:47:15,089 --> 01:47:16,989
what a jerk I'd been,

1467
01:47:17,091 --> 01:47:20,492
but, um...that...

1468
01:47:24,599 --> 01:47:28,000
that when things started
to pan out for her,

1469
01:47:28,102 --> 01:47:31,003
I should have been
more supportive,

1470
01:47:31,105 --> 01:47:32,970
and, uh...

1471
01:47:33,074 --> 01:47:36,168
I just should have
been behind her more.

1472
01:47:39,113 --> 01:47:41,013
Oh, shit.

1473
01:47:43,618 --> 01:47:46,451
Tell her that, um...

1474
01:47:46,554 --> 01:47:49,455
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...

1475
01:47:49,557 --> 01:47:51,457
to a bum like me.

1476
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,961
She's heard me say
"I love you"

1477
01:47:56,063 --> 01:47:57,462
a thousand times.

1478
01:47:57,565 --> 01:48:00,466
She never heard me
say " I'm sorry."

1479
01:48:02,069 --> 01:48:04,970
I want you to
tell her that, Al.

1480
01:48:05,072 --> 01:48:07,472
I want you
to tell her...

1481
01:48:07,575 --> 01:48:10,476
thatJohn said
that he was sorry.

1482
01:48:10,578 --> 01:48:12,978
Okay?
You got that, man?

1483
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,412
Yeah, I got it, John,

1484
01:48:15,516 --> 01:48:18,485
but you can
tell her that yourself.

1485
01:48:18,586 --> 01:48:21,487
Just watch your ass
and make it out.

1486
01:48:21,589 --> 01:48:22,988
You hear me?

1487
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:26,082
I guess that's up to
the man upstairs.

1489

were you doing
upstairs, Hans?

1491

John?

1492
01:48:40,107 --> 01:48:41,506
Al, listen.

1493
01:48:41,609 --> 01:48:43,236
Just lay off
for a while.

1494
01:48:43,344 --> 01:48:46,609
I got to go
check on something.

1495
01:48:50,685 --> 01:48:53,449
One minute,
that's all I'm asking--

1496
01:48:53,554 --> 01:48:56,079
One minute
to speak to them.

1497
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:58,454
All right.
Get back. Get back.

1498
01:48:58,559 --> 01:49:00,459
All right,
look, look, look.

1499

- Let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S. ¿Comprende?

1500
01:49:06,734 --> 01:49:07,962
This is the last time
these kids will have...

1501
01:49:08,069 --> 01:49:09,969
to speak
to their parents.

1502
01:49:12,073 --> 01:49:13,472
- All right?
- Mm.

1503
01:49:13,574 --> 01:49:16,236
All right.
Come on.

1504
01:49:25,753 --> 01:49:28,119
What were you
doing, Hans?

1505
01:49:28,222 --> 01:49:30,588
What were you doing?

Jesus, Mary,
Mother of God.

1508
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,047
It's a double-cross!

1509

01:50:13,668 --> 01:50:15,568
Did you get that?

1514
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:17,570
Something about
a double-cross.

1515
01:50:17,672 --> 01:50:20,072
Tell me about it.

1516
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,580
We are both
professionals.

1517
01:50:29,684 --> 01:50:31,584
This is personal.

Ah...

1519
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:37,949
Aagh!

01:50:49,003 --> 01:50:50,834
Aah!

They're coming!

They're coming!

The choppers
are coming.

01:50:59,647 --> 01:51:01,046
Okay,

01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:04,049
Time to gather your flock,

Your mom and dad
are very important people.

They're very brave people.

1528
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:13,791
Is there something
you'd like to say to them?

1529
01:51:13,894 --> 01:51:17,330
Come home.

1531
01:51:29,176 --> 01:51:34,307

your acquaintance.

1533
01:51:37,251 --> 01:51:39,151
Everyone
to the roof!

1534

Lock them there.
Come right back.

1535
01:51:48,696 --> 01:51:49,594
Ah!

1536
01:52:08,682 --> 01:52:11,674
You should have heard
your brother squeal...

1537
01:52:11,786 --> 01:52:14,846
when I broke
his fucking neck!

1538
01:52:18,259 --> 01:52:20,625
What do you
figure the breakage?

1539
01:52:20,728 --> 01:52:22,628
We take out

I can live
with that.

Get this thing
on the deck.

1543
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:33,970
They're expecting
transports, not gun ships.

up to kidnapping,
