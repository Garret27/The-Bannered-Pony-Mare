00:56:31,117 --> 00:56:32,319
[sighs]

1391
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:35,181
-Why must you leave forever?
-Aw.

1392
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:37,522
-Cheer up, Buttersnout.
-[gasps] Buttersnout?

1393
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:39,453
-I always wanted a nickname.
-Oh.

1394
00:56:39,588 --> 00:56:40,956
Uh, great.

1395
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:42,572
-[both laughing]
-[chatter continues quietly]

1396
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:45,099
Hey, listen, uh, no hard
feelings about the whole,

1397
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,564
you know, pretend relationship

1398
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,985
to entrap you and
your buddies, okay?

1399
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:49,403
Oh.

1400
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,059
[chuckles] Come on,
now. Of course not.

1401
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,304
I mean, to be honest,
I-I wasn't, uh,

1402
00:56:53,439 --> 00:56:54,732
really that into you.

1403
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:56,367
Oh, weird.

1404
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:59,573
'Cause you, uh, you
seemed pretty into me.

1405
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,839
Well, that's...

1406
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,607
-[chuckles]
-Yeah?

1407
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,637
That... You know, I didn't
want to hurt your feelings,

1408
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,517
so, uh, yeah, sorry if
you're disappointed.

1409
00:57:07,652 --> 00:57:09,383
Oh, no, no, no, no, not me.

1410
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:12,253
You see, uh, I'd only be
disappointed if I was into you,

1411
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:16,831
which, uh, as previously
established, I was not, okay?

1412
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,156
Of course.

1413
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,158
Otherwise, this
marshmallow toast

1414
00:57:20,294 --> 00:57:22,729
would be full of
romantic tension.

1415
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:24,296
[chuckles] Hmm.

1416
00:57:25,264 --> 00:57:28,034
[Kitty] Yeah. Of course I did.

1417
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:29,543
[Wolf, normal voice] Oh, really?

1418
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:32,544
So impersonating the
bride was your idea?

1419
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,032
-[Kitty] Absolutely.
-Yeah. Okay.

1420
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:35,812
I hired you.

1421
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:38,312
Therefore, your
ideas are my ideas.

1422
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:39,882
Classy.

1423
00:57:40,018 --> 00:57:41,133
What's going on with
the MacGuffinite?

1424
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:42,950
Oh, just a little
science project.

1425
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:45,821
Ah. So you framed
us for science?

1426
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:48,992
[laughs] Come on,
I had to frame you.

1427
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:51,695
It was the only way to
draw you out of retirement.

1428
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,258
-[chuckles]
-[tool hammering]

1429
00:57:53,394 --> 00:57:55,965
Anyway, you got what
you wanted, so, uh...

1430
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,304
[chuckles] Oh. Oh!

1431
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,741
Right. You want the video.

1432
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:05,810
There we go.

1433
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,275
-Ooh.
-Oh, man.

1434
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,117
Did... did I ever tell
you about my first heist?

1435
00:58:11,252 --> 00:58:12,552
[sighs] Uh, no.

1436
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:15,187
Um, was it a bank?
Jewelry store? [mumbles]

1437
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:17,654
[smacks lips] Lollipop.

1438
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,626
Back in school, we had a teacher

1439
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:22,958
who used to give the
good kids a lollipop.

1440
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:25,894
And maybe it was my
claws or my teeth,

1441
00:58:26,029 --> 00:58:29,167
but she never,
ever looked my way.

1442
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:30,869
It was hurtful.

1443
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:33,773
So one day, when the
old fart wasn't looking,

1444
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:37,639
I snuck into the drawer
and swiped the whole bag.

1445
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,778
[chuckles] After that,

1446
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:44,151
when the kids wanted
lollipops, they came to me.

1447
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,147
Dude, it was amazing, man.

1448
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:50,085
For the first time in my
life, I felt powerful.

1449
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:53,859
I must've pulled off a
hundred jobs since then.

1450
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:58,329
And the more you steal,
the more they respect you.

1451
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:00,531
Hmm. [smacks lips]

1452
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:02,669
Why would you give that up?

1453
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:09,633
You think if you play nice
and follow their rules,

1454
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:14,073
they'll just see you
for who you truly are.

1455
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:17,508
But let me tell you, they won't.

1456
00:59:17,643 --> 00:59:20,445
What if the bad life
was your best life?

1457
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:24,557
[echoing] My advice:

1458
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:29,289
Stop hoping and
enjoy the lollipop.

1459
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:39,607
[breathes deeply]

1460
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,843
[snoring]

1461
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:50,482
-Did you get it?
-Oh, we got it.

1462
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:53,213
Come on, I had to frame you.

1463
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:54,829
It was the only way
to draw you out...

1464
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:56,749
-Full confession.
-[mutes video]

1465
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,337
[Piranha] I can't believe
she didn't notice the camera.

1466
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,089
[Tarantula] All we
need to do is get this

1467
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:01,504
-to the chief and clear our names.
-All right.

1468
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:02,779
-We did it. We did it.
-Whoo! Yeah!

1469
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:04,526
-Woo-hoo!
-Touchdown dance!

1470
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:05,699
[beat boxes]

1471
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:09,366
Hey, buddy.

1472
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:10,970
You okay?

1473
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:12,134
Huh?

1474
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,739
Oh. Uh, nothing.

1475
01:00:14,874 --> 01:00:16,607
Just, uh, imagining
my next round

1476
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,070
of thrilling job interviews.

1477
01:00:19,206 --> 01:00:20,912
Wolfie, this is the plan.

1478
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,574
Yeah. No, I know.
I'm just saying...

1479
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:26,119
[sighs] What am I saying?

1480
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:28,167
I'm just saying, wh... [sighs]
what if we took a wrong turn

1481
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,756
with the whole going good thing?

1482
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:31,824
You know what I mean?

1483
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:35,626
Yeah, but it's gonna
be different this time.

1484
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,994
"Captured the Phantom Bandit."

1485
01:00:38,129 --> 01:00:39,590
That'll look great
on your résumé.

1486
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:41,801
We're gonna be heroes.
Piranha Street.

1487
01:00:42,899 --> 01:00:44,404
Yeah, no, yeah. Totally.

1488
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,837
[stammers, blows raspberries]

1489
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:47,474
What am I talking
about? You're right.

1490
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,169
Come on, let's find the chief.

1491
01:00:49,305 --> 01:00:50,805
-Let's go.
-That's my Wolf.

1492
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,011
[ignition sputtering]

1493
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:56,817
-Uh-oh.
-[light clanks]

1494
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:00,053
Did you really think it
was gonna be that easy?

1495
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,782
Shoot.

1496
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:02,782
-Hey!
-Watch it!

1497
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:03,986
[all grunt]

1498
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:05,488
[singsongy] Naughty, naughty.

1499
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:07,751
Are these gold?

1500
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:10,426
Kitty, can we talk about
this for a second? Uh...

1501
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:12,194
Nope.

1502
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,863
Is that MacGuffinite?

1503
01:01:16,998 --> 01:01:18,101
What's going on?

1504
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,833
How about I show you?

1505
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:21,802
[device beeps]

1506
01:01:21,937 --> 01:01:24,371
[energy crackling]

1507
01:01:25,038 --> 01:01:26,307
Ooh, shiny.

1508
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,409
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1509
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:32,346
[all scream]

1510
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:35,151
[all scream]

1511
01:01:35,951 --> 01:01:37,050
A gold magnet?

1512
01:01:37,186 --> 01:01:39,217
You bet your scaly butt it is.

1513
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:41,356
And this is just a prototype.

1514
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,962
Wait till you see what it
can do in zero gravity.

1515
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:46,724
-You're taking it to space?
-Obviously.

1516
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:48,585
[Pigtail] What do you
think giant rocket is for?

1517
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,033
Is not for science fair.

1518
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:51,672
[Kitty] You can't
expect us to steal

1519
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,440
all the world's
gold from down here.

1520
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,605
The biggest heist in history.

1521
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,169
Courtesy of us.

1522
01:01:58,305 --> 01:01:59,714
All the world's gold?

1523
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,676
Oh. Oh. [chuckles]
And the cherry on top!

1524
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:04,299
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1525
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:06,244
The video? You don't
need to ruin Diane.

1526
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:07,920
Let's... Let's... Come on.

1527
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:09,401
-Let's talk about this.
-Hmm, see, thing is,

1528
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:12,153
I promised this
rodent that I would.

1529
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,561
Kind of a quid pro
quo type thing.

1530
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,727
-Marmalade.
-[Kitty] I know.

1531
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:18,566
What a goofball. [chuckles]

1532
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,698
But a real wiz with
the science stuff.

1533
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,698
I-I'll tell you what.

1534
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:27,131
'Cause we're friends, I'm
gonna give you a choice.

1535
01:02:27,267 --> 01:02:28,802
[all scream, grunt]

1536
01:02:28,937 --> 01:02:29,942
[groaning]

1537
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:32,907
No, no, no, no, no! Stop it.

1538
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:35,816
You can stop it with this.

1539
01:02:37,983 --> 01:02:40,084
-[screams]
-What the...

1540
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:42,581
[all breathing heavily]

1541
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:45,618
The upload is paired
to the magnet.

1542
01:02:45,754 --> 01:02:50,420
The moment you turn it
off, the video goes viral.

1543
01:02:50,556 --> 01:02:52,899
Or leave it on, protect Diane,

1544
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,303
but y'all keep dangling
until the police arrive.

1545
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,967
Oh, such a dilemma.

1546
01:02:59,102 --> 01:03:00,603
[phone beeps, line ringing]

1547
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:02,305
The police?

1548
01:03:02,441 --> 01:03:03,662
[Luggins over phone] Hello.
Commissioner speaking.

1549
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,944
Yes, ma'am. I got a hot tip.

1550
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,244
The Bad Guys are
holed up in a hangar

1551
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:10,245
two klicks north of
the MoonX launch site.

1552
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:11,932
-What? W-Wait. Wh-Who is...
-[phone beeps]

1553
01:03:12,015 --> 01:03:13,587
[chuckles] Sorry, doll.

1554
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:15,053
Look, it's nothing personal.

1555
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,084
You are so hot right now.

1556
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,789
-[others] Snake!
-Yeah?

1557
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:20,925
[Shark] Come on, man.

1558
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,293
You are one twisted reptile.

1559
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:26,424
I wish I could stick
around to see how it ends,

01:29:22,383 --> 01:29:24,133
Sure, we're hurtling
towards Earth in a tin can,

2085
01:29:24,216 --> 01:29:25,741
staring squarely into
the face of death.

2086
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:28,352
Sure, our blood may boil,
our bones may liquefy,

2087
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:31,220
but if there's one thing
that I know about this crew,

2088
01:29:31,356 --> 01:29:35,492
it's that we never,
ever give up.

2089
01:29:35,627 --> 01:29:38,763
Because we have something
that's stronger than fear,

2090
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:41,104
stronger than even gravity.

2091
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:42,500

2092
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:44,374

2100

those brave, beautiful
guys did up there,

2101
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:09,996
saving the world from
a 24-karat catastrophe.

2102
01:30:10,131 --> 01:30:13,506
And despite all the
rejection and suspicion,

2103
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:18,270
all the tiny humiliations,
they did it for us.

2104
01:30:18,405 --> 01:30:21,073
They didn't do it for the
fame or for the glory.

anything to arrest them

(sobs, sighs)

2115
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:50,608
I, for one, am outraged that
it took an evil space magnet

2116
01:30:50,743 --> 01:30:53,235
for people to realize
that the Bad Guys

2117
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,209
were worthy of our
love all along.

2118
01:30:56,345 --> 01:30:59,245
But it's too late,
because now they're dead.

2120
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,279
Ironically, the only survivors

2121
01:31:03,414 --> 01:31:05,119
were the perpetrators
of the heist,

2122
01:31:05,255 --> 01:31:08,286
including the super criminal
known as the Phantom Bandit,

2123
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:12,762
while a second escape pod
was, tragically, empty.

2127

Are you gonna tell us
what this is all about?

2128
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,874
Yeah, 'cause I don't feel dead.

2129
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:32,341
And who are the suits?

2130
01:31:32,477 --> 01:31:35,545

sunglasses inside?
