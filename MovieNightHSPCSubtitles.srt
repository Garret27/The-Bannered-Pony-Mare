I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,193
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,194
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,785
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:52,586
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,955
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:58,592
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,595
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,797
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,599
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,567
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,639
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,686
What is she saying?

28
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,824
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:33,829
That's Jameson.

30
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,117
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,554
I'm awake.

32
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:02,988
Missed me.

33
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,689
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,924
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:09,961
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,463
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,766
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,035
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,671
My meeting?

40
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,538
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,442
My meeting.

42
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,948
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,850
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,752
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:34,586
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:37,523
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,959
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,527
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,029
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,764
That's hot.

51
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,666
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:47,967
I will.

53
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,501
I love you!

54
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,104
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

Hey, Richard!

73
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,272
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,606
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,874
How'd she do?

76
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:02,811
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,812
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,283
You told me what?

79
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,251
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:10,819
The bike.

81
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,223
MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,694
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:20,297
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,198
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,769
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,138
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,772
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,808
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,010
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,713
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,081
Uh...

92
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,083
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,784
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:44,187
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,624
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:50,627
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,031
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:57,967
He's a crook.

99
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,171
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:03,342
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,277
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,045
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:11,115
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,817
All right, all right.

105
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,188
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,856
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,658
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,193
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,162
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:26,365
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,799
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,234
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,903
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,105
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,306
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,308
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,777
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,811
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,049
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:46,118
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,986
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:50,055
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,690
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,159
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:57,263
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,031
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,767
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,569
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:04,870
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:06,272
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,808
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,110
I was going places.

133
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:12,211
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,980
I was going places.

135
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:15,815
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,684
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:21,422
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,094
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,362
Let's just get the check.

140
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,093
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,774
Shh.

142
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,358
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,927
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,197
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,899
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,035
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:15,305
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,507
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,909
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,979
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,914
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,950
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,592
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,221
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,291
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,226
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,163
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,930
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,299
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,501
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,536
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,904
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,107
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,410
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,880
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,761
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,586
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,553
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,590
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,124
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,927
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,430
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,497
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,167
But it's okay.

175
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,203
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,204
All right, you create

177
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,907
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,576
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,580
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,582
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,115
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,950
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,553
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,488
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,055
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,490
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,426
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,929
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,429
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,265
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,066
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,267
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,604
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,905
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:54,507
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,509
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,444
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,514
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,350
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,351
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,954
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,454
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,525
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,960
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,162
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,497
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,064
end up killing people.

208
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:19,567
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:20,934
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,369
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,936
Sorry?

212
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:26,073
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:28,008
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,343
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,944
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,946
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:34,616
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,316
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:37,585
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,387
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,255
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,121
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:41,989
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:43,627
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:49,296
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:51,966
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:54,001
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,541
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:03,978
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,717
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,684
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,251
We do the work.

233
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,724
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,024
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:18,360
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,301
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,304
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,709
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,823
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,579
Hey.

241
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,581
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,114
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,149
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,218
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,453
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,625
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,662
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,499
You used me.

249
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,543
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,178
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,316
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,370
Test 36.

253
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:43,906
Biological interactions

254
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:46,241
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:48,845
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,880
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,715
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:53,918
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,686
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,655
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,894
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,399
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,473
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,946
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,913
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,481
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:29,352
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:33,657
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,358
"We"?

270
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,494
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,462
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,898
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,400
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,082
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,938
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,808
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,343
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,480
Good work.

279
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,937
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:20,906
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:24,543
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,255
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,313
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:29,783
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,482
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,019
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:36,023
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,724
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,027
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,630
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,033
I used to be.

292
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,933
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,569
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:52,540
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:53,940
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,910
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,944
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,946
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,418
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,055
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:10,059
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,427
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,564
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,566
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:21,368
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,839
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:24,906
You did that for me?

308
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,508
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,579
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:33,014
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:34,682
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:37,417
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,889
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:40,655
Deal.

315
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,393
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,697
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,966
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,968
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,137
You look like shit.

321
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,538
Excuse me?

322
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,908
You look like shit.

323
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:02,111
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:04,846
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,716
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,718
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,852
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,056
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:16,859
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,594
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:19,762
That is the problem.

332
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,637
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,039
Please.

334
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,506
Let's go.

335
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,188
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:39,049
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:41,151
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:42,855
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,142
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,143
It just does.

341
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:24,494
I gotta go.

342
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:28,567
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,205
What a dick.

344
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:04,571
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,105
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:07,573
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:09,042
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:11,043
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:17,950
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:19,821
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:31,264
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:35,101
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,570
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:39,206
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:42,943
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,946
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:47,581
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:09,837
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,276
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,945
History starts now.

361
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,647
This is day one.

362
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,917
This is first contact.

363
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,286
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,270
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,607
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,348
Put me through.

367
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,185
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:57,987
There's no need.

369
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:01,023
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:03,059
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:05,194
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,930
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,100
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:13,169
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:16,242
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,780
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,115
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:29,920
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:32,823
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,291
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:36,428
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,730
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,365
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,401
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,939
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,943
We will.

387
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:56,016
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,419
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:03,323
Open it.

390
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,403
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:20,139
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,308
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,461
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:45,165
- Where the hell did it go?
<i>- Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,735
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,905
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:32,215
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:01,277 --> 00:28:03,979
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,380
I was...

400
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:08,116
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:12,287
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,596
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,394
I mean...

404
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,199
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,269
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,206
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,173
Okay.

408
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,242
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,578
I need your help.

410
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,279
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,014
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,016
We're done.

413
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,618
No...

414
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,954
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,023
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,358
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,892
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,961
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,297
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,133
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,202
and they are dying.

422
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,303
They are all dying.

423
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,874
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,043
Come here.

425
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,277
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,445
Because it's true.

427
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,214
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,149
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,319
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,681
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,187
I can't do that.

432
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,990
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,625
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,293
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:23,962
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,164
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,534
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:31,301
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,607
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,142
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:39,444
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,514
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,550
I am.

444
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:46,552
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,019
because I am done.

446
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,389
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:51,624
What shit?

448
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:54,593
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:56,164
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,350
Eddie?

451
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:18,720
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:21,987
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,322
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,091
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,695
Eddie...

456
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,529
This is Dan.

457
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:30,565
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,299
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:33,941
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,034
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:37,037
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,372
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:41,578
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,012
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,548
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,270
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:53,055
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,265
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,634
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:11,105
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:13,508
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,712
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

473
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:18,749
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:22,316
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:24,285
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,323
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:29,323
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:30,760
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,528
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,229
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,632
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:37,769
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

483
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:39,201
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:40,283
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,271
A lot.

486
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:44,674
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,242
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:49,147
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,552
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

490
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:56,054
No, we can't.

491
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:00,190
You did this, Eddie.

492
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:04,762
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

493
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:05,831
You.

494
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,200
<i>Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.</i>

495
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,604
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

496
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,439
Talk to me.

497
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,544
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

498
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,146
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

499
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,753
<i>53.5,
win-909 RPM.</i>

500
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:38,824
Whew.

501
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:41,394
<i>Overpopulation
and climate change.</i>

502
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,530
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

503
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,498
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,535
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:51,370
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:53,472
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,341
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:57,477
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:00,547
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:03,383
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:05,687
A comet?

512
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,755
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,692
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:12,492
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:13,930
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:16,564
Like, aliens?

517
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:17,932

518
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:19,667
Aliens, yeah.

519
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,971
Yes.

520
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:23,405
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,274
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,945
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:34,415
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,284
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:41,757
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,256
So they can live in space?

527
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,692
We call them hosts.

528
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:47,495
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

529
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:49,598
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

530
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,866

We don't know what happened.

- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

585
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,917
Get it out of my sight.

586

- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

590
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:42,997
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

591
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,001
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

592

- Yeah.

593

00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,142
I get claustrophobic, too.

687
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,646
Dr. Lewis?

688
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,012
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,582
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,653
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,832
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,921
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:26,923 --> 00:45:28,624
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,225
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,294
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,928
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,363
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,932
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,267
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,909
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,405
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,640
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,308
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,915
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,254
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,691
Everything was fine.

707
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,527
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:05,529
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:07,063
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,432
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:10,635
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:11,677
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,339
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:20,998
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:25,248
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,688
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:30,987
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,429
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,225
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,261
Such poor design.

721
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:40,096
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,366
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,739
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,675
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:58,418 --> 00:46:59,753
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,153
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,055
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:06,257
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:07,559
Thank you.

730
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:09,126
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,700
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,738
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,741
Excuse me.

734
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,145
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:30,116
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:30,118 --> 00:47:31,786
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,120
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:36,758
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,725
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:40,325
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:44,197
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,098
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,467
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,102
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:51,337
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:53,239
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:55,174
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:58,311
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:58,313 --> 00:48:00,346
but super, super fast?

750
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:02,115
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:03,483
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:05,351
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,521
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:07,523 --> 00:48:10,423
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:12,392
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:13,727
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,296
- Yes.
<i>- Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,801
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:18,035 --> 00:48:19,700
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:22,236
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,705
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:25,607
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:28,509
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:45,260
Yeah?

765
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:46,902
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:48,798
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,298
Whatever.

768
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:55,236
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:55,238 --> 00:48:57,678
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:02,179
I was troubled by

771
00:49:03,213 --> 00:49:04,815
what we've been doing.

772
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,616
I get it.

773
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:07,885
I get it.

774
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:10,587
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:13,157
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:17,863
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:19,564 --> 00:49:20,865
I need that from you.

778
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:26,402
I can't do that.

779
00:49:26,404 --> 00:49:29,842
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:32,143
your friend.

781
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:35,211
The person who was here.

782
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:37,213
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,751
You know that, right?

784
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:42,251
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:42,253 --> 00:49:44,524
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,194
Hey. Dora.

787
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:53,667
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:49:56,903 --> 00:49:58,203
Will you trust me?

789
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:06,744
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:07,914
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:19,259
You were our best.

792
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,593
Open it.

793
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:26,932
No! No!

794
00:50:26,934 --> 00:50:28,936
No! No! No!

795
00:50:33,774 --> 00:50:35,543
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:37,178 --> 00:50:38,376
Huh?

797
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:52,926
Stay put.

798
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,794
- Hey, Eddie.
<i>- Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:56,998
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,932
Whoa.

801
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,701
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,402
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:05,705
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:08,675
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:08,677 --> 00:51:09,978
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:11,611
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,313
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:15,314
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:15,316 --> 00:51:17,516
- Eddie...
<i>- I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:17,518 --> 00:51:19,418
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:22,224
Take him down.

812
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:34,804
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:46,015
- What is that?
<i>- Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:47,717 --> 00:51:48,851
Oh.

815
00:51:58,361 --> 00:51:59,362
Shit.

816
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,618
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,654
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:25,656 --> 00:52:26,755
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:29,561
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,402
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,010
No! No, no, no!

822
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,817
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:57,088
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:08,100
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:09,768
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,640
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:18,076
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:20,079
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:23,080
Treece...

830
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:25,085
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,794
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,838
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,940
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:50,508
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,545
"Parasite"?

836
00:53:58,753 --> 00:54:00,821
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,792
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:08,594
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:10,996
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,499
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:23,009
What?

842
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,476
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:28,013
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,116
Launch the drones.

845
00:54:58,479 --> 00:55:00,613
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:03,617
Whew!

847
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:05,521
- Thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:13,730
Oh!

849
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:24,351
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,815
Oh, God, no!

851
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:56,838
Holy shit!

852
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,115
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:56:06,117 --> 00:56:08,586
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:14,691 --> 00:56:16,828
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:18,129 --> 00:56:19,631
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,173
What the...

857
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:37,149
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:42,320
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:46,811
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:51,097
No!

861
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,919
- That is a dead-end!
<i>- Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:16,723
Whoa!

863
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:23,897
Yeah!

864
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,029
Whoa!

865
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:03,302
I am going to die!

866
00:58:03,304 --> 00:58:04,740
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:16,818 --> 00:58:19,121
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:29,930
I got him.

869
00:58:29,932 --> 00:58:30,997
<i>- Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:32,935
This is incredible.

871
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:42,143
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:45,181
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:58:56,993 --> 00:59:00,962
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:03,433
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:14,078 --> 00:59:16,010
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:17,180
Get off the car!

877
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:35,000
My legs.

878
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,134
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:41,539
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:58,821
What the hell
are you?

881
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:01,291
I am Venom.

882
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:04,060
And you are mine.

883
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:06,429
You bit somebody's head off.

884
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:08,499
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:10,536
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:10,771 --> 01:00:13,003
You did not find us.

887
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:15,575
We found you.

888
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,841
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:19,109
Where are you going?

890
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:22,212
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:24,181
You remember him.

892
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:25,582
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,085
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:29,920
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:32,356
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:34,926
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:39,498 --> 01:00:42,267
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:43,568
Most likely.

899
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,035
Oh, God.

900
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:48,039
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,345
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:00:52,512 --> 01:00:54,615
That is the deal.

903
01:00:58,118 --> 01:00:59,451
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:01,353
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:03,395
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,078
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,912
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,984
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:33,319
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:36,489
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:38,224
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:40,025
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:41,663
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,468
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,344
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,513
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,520
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,588
The arrogance.

919
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:15,564
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:17,700
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:22,335
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,343
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,446
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:32,513
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,449
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,350
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,052
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,088
Bodies?

929
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,492
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,462
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,398
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,736
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,535
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,170
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:56,673
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:02:56,675 --> 01:03:00,209
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:02,010
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,956
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,715
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:03:05,717 --> 01:03:08,016
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,586
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:09,588 --> 01:03:12,155
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:12,157 --> 01:03:13,757
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
<i>- No!</i>

944
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:15,457
- Eddie?
<i>- No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,492
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:16,494 --> 01:03:17,762
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:20,062
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,431
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:22,602
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:23,535 --> 01:03:26,035
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:28,338
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:31,274
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:33,577
<i>- Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:35,579
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:37,648
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,148
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,684
<i>- "We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:42,766
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:44,456 --> 01:03:46,291
Yeah.

960
01:03:52,163 --> 01:03:54,600
- Shit.
<i>- You want up?</i>

961
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,707
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:13,820
Hmm.

963
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:17,254
- It is peaceful up here.
<i>- I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:21,459
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:23,798
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,196
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:35,172
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,485
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:48,590
Whoa.

970
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:57,631
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:04:57,633 --> 01:04:59,766
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,168
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,671
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:06,573
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:09,576
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:11,745
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:13,214
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:14,883
Thank you.

979
01:05:18,754 --> 01:05:19,788
Okay.

980
01:05:21,758 --> 01:05:23,257
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:28,396
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,567
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:43,813
Hands!

984
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:47,483
On the ground! Now!

985
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:54,722
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:56,791
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:05:56,793 --> 01:05:59,292
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:05:59,294 --> 01:06:00,931
- Mask!
<i>- Copy.</i>

989
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:02,698
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:09,472
What the hell?

991
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,306
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,442
Flares!

993
01:06:14,444 --> 01:06:15,544
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:15,546 --> 01:06:16,747
Reload!

995
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,581
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:30,493 --> 01:06:32,428
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:34,165 --> 01:06:36,267
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,614
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:54,385
Where is it?

1000
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:02,492
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:04,895
Throw them!

1002
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:06,428
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:18,743
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:19,810
Above!

1005
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:26,284
There he is!

1006
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:32,358
Move, move, move!

1007
01:08:02,322 --> 01:08:04,022
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:10,397 --> 01:08:11,898
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,732
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:13,734 --> 01:08:16,401
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:16,403 --> 01:08:18,871
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:20,472
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:20,474 --> 01:08:22,909
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,613
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:30,685
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:34,454 --> 01:08:35,455
Right now.

1017
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:41,459
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:42,530
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:47,703
- In the back.
<i>- I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:56,879
I'm out of control.

1021
01:08:58,547 --> 01:09:00,048
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,884
<i>- No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:04,086
What? Why?

1024
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,419
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:11,759
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,562
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:17,133
- Not all sounds.
<i>- And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:20,402
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:23,439
Always.

1030
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,709
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:29,409
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:29,411 --> 01:09:31,713
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:35,052
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:36,354 --> 01:09:38,052
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:40,522
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:43,127
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,832
Annie.

1038
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:54,502
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:09:54,504 --> 01:10:00,508
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,113
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:05,583
And that I love you.

1042
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:08,784
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:08,786 --> 01:10:11,888
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,524
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:22,632
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:25,835
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:25,837 --> 01:10:26,905
Thank you.

1048
01:10:45,525 --> 01:10:46,559
Hello?

1049
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,106
What are you doing here?

1050
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:03,811
Are you lost?

1051
01:11:05,979 --> 01:11:07,981
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:15,556 --> 01:11:17,055
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:17,057 --> 01:11:20,559
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:23,229
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:23,464 --> 01:11:25,964
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:25,966 --> 01:11:27,267
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,834
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,739
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:34,673
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:36,875
- This parasite, whatever this is...
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,176
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:39,812
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:39,814 --> 01:11:41,914
- You're using him up.
<i>- No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:44,950
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:47,552
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
<i>- No!</i>

1066
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,155
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:50,623
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,190
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:11:52,192 --> 01:11:53,752
- Oh, God!
<i>- We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:11:55,063 --> 01:11:56,129
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:57,291
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,837
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:21,054
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:21,056 --> 01:12:22,324
What is that?

1075
01:12:29,298 --> 01:12:32,266
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:35,337
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:41,844
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:44,213
We're done.

1079
01:12:46,582 --> 01:12:48,950
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:48,952 --> 01:12:50,718
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,800
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:12:55,658 --> 01:12:57,192
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:12:57,194 --> 01:13:01,096
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:03,331
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,302
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:10,038
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,773
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:13,908
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:15,178
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:19,983
Dan.

1091
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:28,058
Where is it?

1092
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:55,988
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:22,114 --> 01:14:25,815
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:25,817 --> 01:14:30,420
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:34,460
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:34,694 --> 01:14:36,994
Whoo!

1097
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,334
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:14:51,912 --> 01:14:53,979
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:57,014
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:14:57,016 --> 01:15:00,919
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:02,853
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:15:02,855 --> 01:15:04,323
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:06,091
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:15:06,093 --> 01:15:09,261
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:11,830
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:11,832 --> 01:15:13,265
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:15,802
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,803
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,474
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:23,408
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,211
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,414
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,918
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,422
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:36,424 --> 01:15:38,858
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,427
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:44,497
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:47,900
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:47,902 --> 01:15:49,202
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:51,805
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:53,207
that they're killing you.

1122
01:15:53,209 --> 01:15:54,941
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:57,478
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,014
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:16:00,016 --> 01:16:01,517
Where's Venom?

1126
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:05,318
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:11,394 --> 01:16:15,195
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:17,865
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:17,867 --> 01:16:22,102
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:30,347 --> 01:16:35,553
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:35,787 --> 01:16:39,187
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:41,391
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:45,193
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:46,928
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:50,200
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:53,137
I can take care of that.

1137
01:16:58,175 --> 01:17:01,177
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:02,180
Shut up.

1139
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:07,619
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:12,524 --> 01:17:14,192
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:18,562
God damn it!

1142
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:23,600
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:25,603
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:25,605 --> 01:17:27,370
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:28,572
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:29,374 --> 01:17:31,609
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:36,115
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:40,317
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:41,554
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:45,290
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:49,995 --> 01:17:51,061
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:51,063 --> 01:17:53,097
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:55,932
Oh...

1154
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:56,935
Mmm...

1155
01:17:57,971 --> 01:17:59,172
Mmm!

1156
01:18:15,422 --> 01:18:16,590
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:20,592
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:23,095
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:25,699
<i>- The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:25,932 --> 01:18:28,433
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:28,435 --> 01:18:30,501
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:30,503 --> 01:18:32,823
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
<i>- He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:34,505
- Oh, great.
<i>- We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:34,507 --> 01:18:36,208
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,644
- Well, I'm coming with you.
<i>- No!</i>

1166
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,546
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,028
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:44,985
Not today.

1169
01:18:46,454 --> 01:18:48,055
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:51,726
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,126
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,564
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,297
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:18:58,299 --> 01:18:59,999
How long?

1175
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,701
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:05,073
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,410
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:15,348
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,317
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,721
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:22,355
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:26,728
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,970
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,698
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,466
- on a whole planet?
<i>- Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,669
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:37,238
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,273
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,779
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,746
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:44,748 --> 01:19:47,414
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:50,050
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:53,790
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,156
- then it's back to "we."
<i>- It is "we."</i>

1195
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,560
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:19:58,562 --> 01:20:00,262
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:20:00,264 --> 01:20:01,744
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:20:05,536 --> 01:20:08,505
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:13,174
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:15,547
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:25,320
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:27,659
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,740
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:51,316 --> 01:20:54,252
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:21:01,727 --> 01:21:05,494
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:21:05,496 --> 01:21:08,197
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:10,299
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:13,737
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:16,643
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:21,748
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:25,451 --> 01:21:28,253
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:31,525 --> 01:21:34,358
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,496
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:38,498 --> 01:21:39,832
Then die.

1215
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:52,578
<i>- Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,214
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:08,194
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:11,799
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:53,305
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,646
Eddie.

1221
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,552
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:08,821 --> 01:24:11,289
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,733
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:38,718 --> 01:24:40,416
You're too late.

1225
01:24:40,418 --> 01:24:41,419
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:45,725
You talk too much.

1227
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:57,069
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:24:57,304 --> 01:24:58,939
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:28,903
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,805
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:32,707
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:34,642
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:35,408 --> 01:25:36,409
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:36,944 --> 01:25:37,979
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,411
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:40,413 --> 01:25:41,947
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:41,949 --> 01:25:43,816
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:43,818 --> 01:25:45,821
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:48,789
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:57,764
Traitor!

1241
01:25:57,766 --> 01:25:59,533
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:25,827 --> 01:26:27,195
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:29,899
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:17,948 --> 01:27:21,918
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1245
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,517
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1246
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,256
I feel great. Awesome.

1247
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:27,257
Wow.

1248
01:27:27,491 --> 01:27:29,158
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1249
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,662
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1250
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,664
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1251
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,631
You're a good person, Annie.

1252
01:27:36,633 --> 01:27:38,134
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:39,969
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1254
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:42,005
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1255
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,107
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1256
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:48,545
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1257
01:27:48,547 --> 01:27:50,647
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1258
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:52,983
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1259
01:27:52,985 --> 01:27:55,619
Oh! Like everyone else.

1260
01:27:55,621 --> 01:27:56,622
Yeah.

1261
01:27:59,058 --> 01:28:01,293
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1262
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:04,195
Hey, um...

1263
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:08,699
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1264
01:28:08,701 --> 01:28:11,904
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1265
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:17,275
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1266
01:28:17,277 --> 01:28:19,679
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1267
01:28:22,181 --> 01:28:24,551
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1268
01:28:25,184 --> 01:28:26,618
I mean, the...

1269
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,155
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1270
01:28:30,157 --> 01:28:31,723
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1271
01:28:31,725 --> 01:28:32,826
Okay.

1272
01:28:34,127 --> 01:28:35,727
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1273
01:28:35,729 --> 01:28:37,962
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1274
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:41,699
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1275
01:28:41,701 --> 01:28:44,636
No, I don't think so.

1276
01:28:44,638 --> 01:28:47,105
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1277
01:28:47,107 --> 01:28:48,907
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1278
01:28:48,909 --> 01:28:51,311
- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1279
01:28:51,546 --> 01:28:53,079
Eddie, are you sure?

1280
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:55,080
Good Lord, look at that.

1281
01:28:55,082 --> 01:28:57,217
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1282
01:28:58,986 --> 01:29:01,153
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:01,155 --> 01:29:03,290
You take care, all right?

1284
01:29:03,559 --> 01:29:05,359
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1285
01:29:09,297 --> 01:29:12,731
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1286
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:13,901
Either of you.

1287
01:29:14,635 --> 01:29:16,001
We won't.

1288
01:29:16,003 --> 01:29:17,703
<i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1289
01:29:17,705 --> 01:29:20,272
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1290
01:29:20,274 --> 01:29:22,942
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1291
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:25,878
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1292
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,648
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1293
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:31,386
<i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1294
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,319
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1295
01:29:33,321 --> 01:29:36,890
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1296
01:29:36,892 --> 01:29:39,192
And then there are bad people.

1297
01:29:39,194 --> 01:29:41,061
You have to tell
the difference.

1298
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:44,931
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1299
01:29:44,933 --> 01:29:48,301
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1300
01:29:48,303 --> 01:29:50,737
eat very, very bad people,

1301
01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:53,408
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1302
01:29:53,642 --> 01:29:56,009
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.

1303
01:29:56,011 --> 01:29:57,778
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1304
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,880
Well, it's super simple.

1305
01:29:59,882 --> 01:30:02,783
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1306
01:30:02,785 --> 01:30:04,852
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1307
01:30:04,854 --> 01:30:06,287
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1308
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:08,356
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1309
01:30:08,358 --> 01:30:13,793
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1310
01:30:13,795 --> 01:30:16,099
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1311
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:19,969
Hey, Mrs. C.

1312
01:30:21,037 --> 01:30:22,737
How you doing, Eddie?

1313
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,306
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1314
01:30:24,308 --> 01:30:27,275
No.

1315
01:30:27,277 --> 01:30:30,414
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1316
01:30:30,648 --> 01:30:32,313
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1317
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:33,982
Right. Okay, no problem.

1318
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:36,819
The payment's due, Chen.

1319
01:30:38,322 --> 01:30:40,321
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1320
01:30:40,323 --> 01:30:41,890
Now.

1321
01:30:41,892 --> 01:30:43,460
<i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1322
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:53,068
You come in here again...

1323
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:57,739
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1324
01:30:57,741 --> 01:31:01,243
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1325
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:03,245
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1326
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:06,316
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1327
01:31:06,318 --> 01:31:08,218
- Please...
- Yes.

1328
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:12,121
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1329
01:31:12,123 --> 01:31:16,893
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1330
01:31:16,895 --> 01:31:19,264
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1331
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:23,735
We are Venom.

1332
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:27,339
- On second thought...
- Please.

1333
01:31:34,412 --> 01:31:36,813
Eddie? What was that?

1334
01:31:36,815 --> 01:31:38,214
Oh...

1335
01:31:38,216 --> 01:31:42,021
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1336
01:31:43,356 --> 01:31:44,888
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:46,890
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1338
01:31:46,892 --> 01:31:48,892
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.

1339
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:51,829
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1340
01:31:51,831 --> 01:31:54,535
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1341
01:31:54,767 --> 01:31:58,902
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1342
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:28,123
I need you
to stay quiet.

1343
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:31,093
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1344
01:34:31,095 --> 01:34:34,231
- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1345
01:34:38,571 --> 01:34:40,136
Open on five.

1346
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,273
Go. Opening up.

1347
01:34:45,342 --> 01:34:48,044
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1348
01:34:48,046 --> 01:34:50,581
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1349
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:52,314
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1350
01:34:52,316 --> 01:34:54,484
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1351
01:34:54,486 --> 01:34:57,120
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1352
01:34:57,122 --> 01:35:00,256
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1353
01:35:00,258 --> 01:35:03,696
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1354
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:07,399
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1355
01:35:10,469 --> 01:35:13,372
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1356
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,160
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1357
01:35:36,162 --> 01:35:40,599
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1358
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:41,768
Sure, it's good with me.

1359
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:44,335
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1360
01:35:44,337 --> 01:35:51,208
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1361
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,278
I bet you can.

1362
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,750
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1363
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:57,619
Come on over.

1364
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,053
All right.

1365
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,391
I'm here.

1366
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:10,129
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1367
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,434
there's gonna be carnage.

1368
01:48:23,955 --> 01:48:26,123
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1369
01:48:27,825 --> 01:48:29,892
I want to do what you asked.

1370
01:48:29,894 --> 01:48:31,528
I really do.

1371
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:33,829
But... I'm sorry.

1372
01:48:38,102 --> 01:48:40,503
I can't do this without you.

1373
01:48:41,973 --> 01:48:43,039
Hey, kid...

1374
01:48:43,041 --> 01:48:44,340
Whoa.

1375
01:48:44,342 --> 01:48:45,343
What was... Whoa!

1376
01:48:49,213 --> 01:48:50,214
What?

1377
01:48:52,251 --> 01:48:53,285
Huh?

1378
01:49:01,894 --> 01:49:02,895
No.

1379
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,100
Who are you?

1380
01:49:09,102 --> 01:49:10,462
What are you
doing over there?

1381
01:49:11,338 --> 01:49:13,270
Freeze! PDNY.

1382
01:49:13,272 --> 01:49:15,272
Kid, freeze!

1383
01:49:18,911 --> 01:49:20,045
You're kidding me right now?

1384
01:49:22,115 --> 01:49:23,516
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1385
01:49:32,526 --> 01:49:33,925
Ow!

1386
01:49:33,927 --> 01:49:35,128
Somebody stop that train!

1387
01:49:47,575 --> 01:49:48,643
Aah!

1388
01:49:57,586 --> 01:49:59,084
Sorry.

1389
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:10,563
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i>

1390
01:50:10,565 --> 01:50:12,097
<i>dragging a homeless corpse</i>

1391
01:50:12,099 --> 01:50:13,399
<i>behind a train.</i>

1392
01:50:13,401 --> 01:50:14,847
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1393
01:50:14,871 --> 01:50:16,202
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1394
01:50:16,204 --> 01:50:17,604
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1395
01:50:37,225 --> 01:50:40,427
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1396
01:50:40,429 --> 01:50:42,964
All right.
Thanks, New York.
