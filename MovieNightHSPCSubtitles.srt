Voyager will never see
those who made it again.

39

solitary and alone.

41

receive its message

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,000
[soldier chuckles]
This ought to be good.

182
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,750
[indistinct whispering]

183
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,667
All right, Mr. Melmac,
let's hear it.

184
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,958
Major… [winces]

185
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,542
Major Solís, earlier today,

186
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,625
I found this signal coming
from interstellar space.

187
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,542
[mysterious sounds playing]

188
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,917
[Olga] Melmac, please.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
-It's late…
-Wait, wait, wait.

190
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,083
Listen closely.

191
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,042
[child's voice, distorted]
Hello, Planet Earth.

192
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,417
Hello, Planet Earth.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
In 1977, NASA launched the…

194
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,084
-The Golden Record.
-The Golden Record! Yes.

195
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,208
-The what?
-The Golden Record, sir,

196
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:27,792
was Earth's message in a bottle.

197
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,458
[child's voice] Hello from
the children of Planet Earth.

198
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:31,542
Don't you see?

199
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,334
[child's voice, distorted]
Hello, Planet Earth.

200
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,125
I think someone in
interstellar space

201
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,125
found our message and
is sending it back to us

202
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,208
as a reply!

203
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,292
-Melmac…
-Major…

204
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,750
-Melmac…
-Major!

205
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,292
We can't just leave it like
this, we have to respond.

206
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,042
I've already rerouted
every satellite

207
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,125
to send the signal back.

208
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,083
Sure, it might cause
a few system failures.

209
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,083
Whoop. Sorry. Maybe a
small electrical fire,

210
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,583
but it would be worth
it for first contact!

211
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,834
I have everything cued
up and ready to go.

212
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,500
Just say the word!

213
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:03,292
If someone or something
is calling out to Earth,

214
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,625
who on Earth do you
want taking that call?

215
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,875
-You…
-[gasps]

216
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,500
-…should go home.
-Oh.

217
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,208
-Take a week.
-[soldier] Take two weeks.

218
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,292
No. You got to believe me.

219
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,875
Major, please!
They're out there!

220
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,125
Major! [screams] Unhand me!

221
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:24,500
[sighs] May I remind everyone
that we are orbital analysts.

222
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,792
We track space debris,
not rogue UFO signals.

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,917
Let's just… [sighs]

224
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,708
Let's just take five.

225
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,000
It's been a long night.

226
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
What a nutjob.

227
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,583
[♪ Tense music playing]

228
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,208
This is Elio Solís of
the planet Earth. Uh…

229
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,792
I come in peace…

230
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,583
And I'm super excited
to join you. Uh…

231
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,750
I'm creative, hardworking…

232
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,875
Shredded.

233
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Uh, so please come and
get me. I'll be waiting.

234
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,167
Okay, bye. Love you.

235
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,917
Yes.

236
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,250
Yes!

237
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,833
Yes!

238
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,583
[exclaims]

239
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,667
[chuckles]

240
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,042
[Olga] Oh, no.

241
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,500
Time is of the essence. They
could be here any minute.

242
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,458
I got to pack!

243
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,708
I take full responsibility,

244
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,875
but… [chuckles] …I mean,
you have kids, right?

245
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,459
I'll be out of your
way soon. Don't worry.

246
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,792
Just need a few
snacks for the road.

247
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,708
Elio!

248
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,750
Sorry, ma'am. What was that?

249
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,375
Which flavor will you
miss the least? ¿Fuego?

250
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,459
-Fuego. Yeah.
-I-I understand.

251
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,459
Should I bring forks, or would
they think they're weapons?

252
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,333
Not worth the risk!
I'll bring spoons.

253
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,417
Nice, peaceful spoons.

254
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
-Where's my good cape?
-You too, ma'am.

255
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,767
-It's not in the wash, is it?
-Thank you.

256
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,542
-Ah. Here it is!
-Elio…

257
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,792
Blue or green? Which one
says, "Take me with you,"

258
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
but not in a desperate way?

259
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,292
Elio, stop! Please!

260
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,375
Aliens are not coming for you.

261
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,625
But that guy said…

262
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,792
You're out of control.
You got in a fight.

263
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,083
You shut down power
to the whole base

264
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,083
and I almost lost my job!

265
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,833
[Olga sighs]

266
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,917
We have to try
something different.

267
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,292
Boarding school? You're
trying to get rid of me.

268
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,708
No, this is just
their sleep away camp.

269
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,792
It's just a couple of weeks.

270
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,167
I can't go. They're
coming tonight.

271
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,875
You need to make friends
or just a friend.

272
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,167
I don't care about friends.
I need to meet aliens.

273
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,250
Why?

274
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,000
Because there's 500 million
habitable planets out there

275
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,542
and one of them's
got to want me!

276
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,292
Because obviously you don't!

277
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,250
Of course, I do! We're family!

278
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,958
You're not my family!

279
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,625
[sighs]

280
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,417
Your life isn't up there, Elio.

281
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,958
It's down here.

282
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,500
[grunts]

283
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,458
[Olga] I-I can't deal with this.

284
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,833
I don't know if anybody
can deal with this.

285
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,750
[sighs]

286
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,458
When I drop him off tomorrow,

287
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,583
I'm going to see if they
can enroll him in the fall.

288
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,750
I know,

289
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:29,667
but this just isn't how I
thought my life would be.

290
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,459
[narrator on recording]
It's an ancient human theme.

291
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,625
You can find it in
virtually every culture,

292
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,125
in, uh, religion,
folklore, superstition

293
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,375
and now in science.

294
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,500
[Elio crying]

295
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,458
The search for life elsewhere
is remarkable in our age,

296
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,875
because this is the first time

297
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,042
that we can actually do
something besides speculation.

298
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
We can send spacecraft
to nearby planets.

299
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,417
We can use large
radio telescopes

300
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,125
to see if there is any message
being sent to us lately…

301
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,375
And it touches to the
deepest of human concerns.

302
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,833
Are we alone?

303
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,000

here, too, when I was a kid.

You might not
believe me right now…

308

But this will be good for you.

309
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,542

Yeah… You found me.

376
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,083
This is payback.

377
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,458
Eh, it's okay. You don't
need to pay me back.

378
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,667

I promise I'll pull my weight

477
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,833
You mean I could stay here?

478
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,750
If all the members
agree, then, yes.

479
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:29,625
You'll be one of us and be the
proud bearer of one of these.

Hello. I am the
Universal Users Manual.

I contain the secrets
of the universe.

498
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,125
What is the meaning of life?

499
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,167
What lies beyond a black
hole? Is there a purpose to…

500
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,208
[Elio] Who would win in a fight?

501
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,750
One gorilla with a
baseball bat or ten chimps?

502
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,792
None who fight are true winners.

503
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,250
Huh?

Wow.

507
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,125
These little critters
are mimollusks.

508
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,625
They use nanotechnology to
construct anything you desire.

-[Questa] Gets me every time.
-Bracing.

520
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,333
It's like I was always
meant to be here.

521
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,583
I knew you were looking for me.

522
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,542
Of course we were
looking for you.

523
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,625
Ever since we picked up

524
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,333
this charming little
spacecraft you sent us.

525
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,792
[gasps] Voyager?

526
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,750
[Helix] We found it
in an asteroid field.

527
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,625
[Tegmen] Nice craftsmanship.

528
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,708
Um… thanks?

529
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,375
[Helix] Curious about
the species who made it,

530
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,000
we sent an invitation

531
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,542
and were delighted to receive
your planet's official reply.

532
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,625
[distorted] This is Elio
Solís of the planet Earth

533
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,917
and I'm super
excited to join you.

534
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,833
I'm creative,
hard-working, shredded!

00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,083
[static, interference]

536
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,292
So, please come and get
me. I'll be waiting.

537
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,667
Okay, bye. Love you.

538
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,833
-[Tegmen] Very touching.
-We are delighted

539
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,042
to finally make
your acquaintance,

540
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,417
Leader of Uh-Earth.

541
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,250
Ooh.

542
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,167
Uh…

543
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,833
[Tegmen] Why is
your face melting?

544
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:04,792
Um…

545
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,000
-Well…
-Ambassadors,

546
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,000
an urgent matter
requires your attention.

547
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,708
It involves the other candidate.

548
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,167
-Oh, him.
-[Questa] Oh, dear.

549
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,584
[Helix] We should
hurry. Quickly now!

550
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,667
[Questa] Excuse us.

551
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,583
Please join us.

552
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,875
Your technology and my weapons

553
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:27,125
would be an
unstoppable alliance.

554
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,875
Now, admit me to
your Communiverse!

555
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,458
[ambassadors muttering]

556
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,583
Unfortunately, Candidate Grigon,

557
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,875
it is our assessment
that you are

558
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,042
not a fit.

559
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,208
I, Lord Grigon,

560
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:44,708
Blood Emperor of
Hylurg, not a fit?

561
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:49,167
Well, we believe in tolerance
and open-mindedness…

562
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,583
I am tolerant!

563
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,208
So sorry, it's not you,

564
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,875
it's us.

565
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,792
[Tegmen] I thought
we said it was him.

566
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,708
[Helix] Shh!

567
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:02,417
If I cannot join
the Communiverse,

568
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,417
then I shall take it by force!

569
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,542
Prepare to be conquered!

570
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,042
[ambassadors screaming]

571
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,250
[ambassador 4] What a brute!

572
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,583
Why did he make a new hole?

573
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,208
[Naos] I suggest
we run and hide.

574
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,875
Yes, let's go to the
edge of the cosmos

575
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,208
and turn off all the lights.

576
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:21,000
Uh, that includes me, right?

577
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,208
Oh, so sorry, candidate Solís,

578
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,958
we couldn't possibly
accept new members

579
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,625
under the current situation.

580
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,667
Applications are
closed indefinitely.

581
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,417
-But I just got here!
-[Helix] Such a shame.

582
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,125
Let's check back in
a few thousand years?

583
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,875
Perhaps one of us could
talk to Lord Grigon.

584
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:36,958
-You do it!
-Not me.

585
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,833
-I am shy.
-I'm busy.

586
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,667
-I have allergies.
-[Naos] My battery is low.

587
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,292
Don't worry. I'll return
you to your life on Uh-Earth

588
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,583
just as it was…
[echoing] was, was, was…

589
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,500
Just as it was…

590
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,708
No, no!

591
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,042
I'll do it.

592
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,458
[panting]

593
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:56,875
I'm the leader of Earth.

594
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,333
I'm the perfect guy for the job.

595
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,125
[Helix] What did it say?

596
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,584
-[ambassador 4] How curious.
-[Tegmen] I do not understand.

597
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,125
You would talk to Lord Grigon?

598
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,083
[Naos] But what would you say?

599
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,542
Are you an expert on
conflict negotiation?

600
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,875
[sputters] You kidding?

601
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,583
My life is nothing but conflict

602
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,458
and I've got the battle
scars to prove it.

603
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,417
It would be a welcome change

604
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,833
not to flee every bully
who covets our treasures.

605
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,625
[in alien language]

606
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,917
Yes. What's in it for you?

607
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,875
Why would you agree to
such a dangerous mission?

608
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:30,542
Because…

609
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,083
You need me.

610
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:36,792
And at my age, it's
really about giving back.

611
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,208
If you can make Grigon go away,

612
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,333
we'd make you a
member on the spot.

613
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:42,333
[giggles]

614
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,792
Then I, the leader of
Earth, am ready to serve.

615
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,250
-[Tegmen] Good. Very good.
-How impressive!

616
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,125
-[ambassador 2] What courage!
-[Naos] Wonderful!

617
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,333
Candidate Solís, you
continue to surprise.

618
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,750
When Grigon returns, we
shall be ready for him.

619
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,375
Until then, as you
say on Uh-Earth.

620
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,500
Okay, bye. I love you.

621
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,917
[ambassadors, together]
Okay. Bye. I love you.

622
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,667
Don't worry. I got this.

623
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,458
You're in great hands.

624
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,250
[restrained shrieking]

625
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,167
Just one last order of business.

626
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,833
Oh, yeah, of course.

627
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,792
While you negotiate
with the warlord,

628
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,167
you'll need a
temporary replacement.

629
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,083
[Elio] Whoa.

630
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,167
[Ooooo] Can I trouble
you for a DNA sample?

631
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,708
Sure. Where do
you want it… Argh!

632
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,667
Yeow! [groans]

633
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,542
Wow. My first probe.

634
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,000
[Elio laughing]

635
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,792
World leaders, such as yourself,

636
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,083
can't just disappear.

637
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,417
Your planet would
descend into chaos.

638
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,458
[ticking]

639
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,792
That's what cloning clay is for.

640
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:45,958
[bell dings]

641
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,875
Whoa.

642
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,958
[♪ Dramatic music playing]

643
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,542
[both] Whoa.

644
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:07,833
Is this…?

645
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,417
Are you…?

646
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,333
[both] Me?

647
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,250
[both laugh]

648
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,250
Rock…

650
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,542
[both] Black hole! Oh!

651
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,375
-Space is the best!
-Space is amazing!

652
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,708
In you go.

653
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:23,875
Sorry.

654
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,083
It's a living.

655
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,792
So, what is my motivation?

656
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:27,958
What do you mean?

657
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,625
Should I change anything

658
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,292
or just stick with
the low self-esteem

659
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,333
and desperation to belong?

660
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,583
What? I'm normal,
just be normal.

661
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,000
No weird stuff, okay?

662
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,708
-Okay.
-Okay.

663
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:46,792
Have fun.

-[blow lands]
-[Other Elio grunts]

Intriguing Uh-Earth
custom. The warlord awaits.

666
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,500
Oh, uh, there was,
uh, just a few things

667
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,917
I wanted to brush up on.

668
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,625
Where was that thing that knew
everything about everything?

669
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
You mean this?

670
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,875
Hello. I am the
Universal Users Manual.

671
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,833
Would you like to learn the
meaning of life now? It's a…

672
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:04,917
No. I need everything you've got

673
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,583
on how to negotiate
with the warmonger.

674
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,125
[sighs]

675
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,542
Certainly.

676
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,667
I have chapters on
leading with empathy.

677
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,583
Nope.

678
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:13,959
-[UUM] Fostering connection?
-Nope.

679
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,583
[UUM] Making the killer deal?

680
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,375
Yes, that one. Do
you have a pen?

681
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,292
In the increasingly likely
event that you will die,

682
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,333
would you like to notify
your next of kin on Uh-Earth?

683
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:24,542
No, that's okay.

684
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,875
[UUM] Start from a
position of power.

685
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,542
The most important
thing is to stay calm.

686
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,458
Don't you tell me to stay calm!

687
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,625
What is this, huh? A
camp or a fight club?

688
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,583
He's an innocent little boy,

689
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,625
and if this is what you
call "building character,"

690
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,167
then I'll take it up with
your... with your boss,

691
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,750
-or her... her boss.
-[Other Elio humming]

692
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,000
Everyone's boss!

693
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,375
Unacceptable!

694
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,917
I never should
have left you here.

695
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,333
Yeah, they chased me
because I'm weak and small,

696
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,917
but there was pizza for dinner.

697
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,583
So, overall, a
pretty good night.

698
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,333
How's the eye? Swollen?

699
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:00,542
-Did they hurt it?
-It's fine.

700
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,458
I'm-I'm… I'm so sorry
I didn't check in.

701
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,750
Something weird was happening.

702
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,250
That's okay.

703
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,417
I was tracking this
crazy signal from space…

704
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,167
Are we going home?
What's for dinner?

-[static on radio]
-Um…

706
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,458
Mac and cheese.

707
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,000
I just thought
you'd be interested

708
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,417
because if aliens were
calling from space…

[radio announcer] Early
morning fog and clouds

710
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,125
along the coast…

711
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,125
Elio?

712
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,792
Are we doing regular or
white cheddar? I'm starved.

713
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,833
So, you-you-you don't
want to talk about aliens?

714

I'm too young to die.

897
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,917
I'm too young to die.

898
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,042
[disc whirs, beeps]

899
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,750
[distorted] What's happening?
[clear] What's happening?

900
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,500
Whoa. Translator disc, cool.

901
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,000
-Are you going to eat me?
-What?

902
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,625
Ew. I was just swaddling you
because you seemed scared.

903
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,792
That's what my mom
does when I get scared.

904
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,375
I'm rarely unswaddled.

905
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,958
You're just a little kid.

906
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,250
So? Don't have to
be rude about it.

907
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,875
Oh. No, no, no. Hey, come back!

908
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,292
I wasn't making fun of you!

909
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:11,208
[strains]

910
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,583
Uh, my name's Elio.

911
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,333
W-What's your name?

912
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,500
You really want to know my name?

913
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,583
Well, I really want to get down.

914
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,833
I'm Glordon! No one's ever
asked me my name before.

915
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:24,750
[Elio screams]

916
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,500
I mean, I ask a lot of
questions all the time.

917
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,958
No one ever asks me about
questions about me, though.

918
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,583
Like what my favorite color is.

919
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,542
It's purple, if you're
asking. Are you asking?

920
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,625
[yelps]

921
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,208
[shrieks]

922
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,042
What's wrong with you?
That's just my carapace.

923
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,042
-W-What?
-I'll show you.

924
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,583
Ta-da!

925
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,667
Whoa.

926
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,875
Every Hylurgian gets one
when they come of age.

927
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,333
It's got weapons
and bombs and stuff.

928
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:01,958
Ooh, and a cup holder!

929
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:03,583
It's bespoke.

930
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,625
So, if Hylurgians
took off their armor,

931
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,708
they'd look like you?

932
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,917
Yeah, but nobody
would ever do that.

933
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,208
To expose your soft, warm flesh

934
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:14,292
would dishonor you
and your whole family

935
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,792
for all eternity.

936
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,208
I can't wait to get installed.

937
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,250
I'm going to look so hot.

938
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,167
[alarm blaring]

939
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,083
[voice on PA] Alert! A
prisoner has escaped.

940
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,708
-Oh, no.
-Are they talking about you?

941
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,125
Uh, it's a complicated
political situation.

942
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,375
You-You wouldn't understand.

943
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:28,584
Are you a treacherous dissident?

944
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,084
[guard 1] Where is he?
Check every chamber!

945
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,000
[Glordon] Are you an assassin?

946
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,250
[guard 1] You two with me. Move!

947
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,125
-What'd you do?
-Uh, uh…

948
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,417
Come on, I'm really
good at keeping secrets.

949
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,120
-[guard 2] Nothing here, sir.
-[guard 1] Keep looking!

950
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,875
The secret is…

951
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,542
I'm a kid.

952
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,958
What? Really?

953
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,417
Mm-hmm.

954
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,958
[whispering] And I kind of
tricked the Communiverse…

955
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,500
-[unintelligible whispering]
-Whoa.

956
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,417
What?

957
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,333
-[whispering continues]
-Oh.

958
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:54,500
No way!

959
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,042
[chuckles] You're crazy.

960
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:59,167
I know and now Grigon's
going to blow everyone up

961
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,375
unless I can find
a bargaining chip.

962
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:05,167
Something he values, but what
does he even value? [sighs]

963
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,792
Well, Dad values blood, glory,
the misery of his enemies.

964
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,042
Ooh. There was this one time…

965
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,750
Hold up. Grigon's your dad?

966
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,083
I thought you knew.
I look just like him.

967
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,708
Check it out. [grunting]

968
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,583
I've been working on my back.

969
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,458
Can I ask you a big favor?

970
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,750
Sure.

971
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,667
[Glordon] Bargaining chip. Cool.

972
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,458
I've never been a
bargaining chip before.

973
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,792
I've been a liability.
A disappointment.

974
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,167
-A deduction.
-Are we almost to my ship?

975
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,375
Not far now. I've also
been a pillow, an enigma,

976
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,208
a problem, a headache.

977
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,667
-Little help, please.
-[strains]

978
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,167
Lately, I've just been ignored,

979
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,875
but now my dad's finally
going to pay attention to me.

980
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,875
Do your parents pay
attention to you?

981
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,958
Well, my Aunt Olga doesn't care.

982
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,375
[straining] With me out the way

983
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,500
she can do what
she really wants.

984
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,333
Like be an astronaut
or whatever.

985
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:07,500
She gave up being an
astronaut or whatever for you?

986
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,250
Wow. She must really love you.

987
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,292
No, no, she doesn't.

988
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,167
But now I'm free to
join the Communiverse,

989
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,083
which is where I belong anyway

990
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,833
and that's where you come in,

991
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,250
bargaining chip.

992
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,417
-[Elio grunts]
-Whee!

993
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,042
-[Glordon] Ow.
-Oof!

994
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,125
-[Glordon strains] Wiggle.
-[rumbling]

995
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,625
[strains] Wiggle.

996
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:31,333
[Helix] Candidate Solís?
Sorry to bother you.

997
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,917
It's just that the
Hylurgian ships

998
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,292
seem to be pointing
their cannons at us.

999
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,375
Is this part of
the negotiations?

1000
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,917
Oh, that's just a
drill. Don't worry.

1001
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,083
[strains] Wiggle.

1002
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:44,417
[Glordon laughs]

1003
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,833
-Whoa. [grunts]
-Come on.

1004
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:49,333
What are these
tunnels for, anyway?

1005
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:52,542
Oh, these are the lava flumes.
They power the cannons.

1006
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,375
Glordon, I am not fireproof!

1007
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:57,834
Really? Why didn't
you say something?

1008
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:58,958
Glordon!

1009
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:01,625
It's okay. Just get in my mouth.

1010
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,917
What? No way!

1011
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,083
Trust me.

1012
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,917
[screaming]

1013
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:14,042
Hmm.

1014
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,333
It's, uh, actually
kind of comfy in here.

1015
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,084
[Glordon] It is? I've
never been in there.

1016
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,167
Hold on.

1017
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,000
[laughs]

1018
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,542
Yeah!

1019
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:30,583
Ah. Refreshing.

1020
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,417
[coughs]

1021
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
[muffled] You okay?

1022
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,917
[Elio] Yes!

1023
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,458
Lower me down.

1024
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,750
[sighs] Thanks, Glordon.

1025
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,958
Eh. It's nothing. Up top.

1026
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,083
How long's the flight?
Any snacks on board?

1027
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,750
Ah, it's Candidate Solís!

1028
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm sure he's
bringing good news.

1029
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:58,917
Oh.

1030
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Look out!

1031
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,083
[slow-motion screaming]

1032
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,125
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

1033
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,125
I'm so excited.

1034
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,875
-Candidate Solís?
-What's happened?

1035
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,958
Ooooo, open a line
to Lord Grigon!

1036
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,083
-Of course.
-Who is this?

1037
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,625
Who is responsible for…

1038
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:18,542
-You!
-[Elio] Yes.

1039
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,042
It's me! The leader of Earth.

1040
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,042
And the negotiation is not over

1041
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,083
because now I've got this!

1042
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,000
-[Helix gasps]
-Oh, my.

1043
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,333
[gasps] Glordon?

1044
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:31,833
Yes, and-and pretty soon
he's going to be Glor-done.

1045
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:33,833
Hi, Dad. I'm a bargaining chip.

1046
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,125
No. Say the other thing.

1047
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,917
Oh. Help me, Father.
He overpowered me.

1048
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
He's too strong. Too shredded.

1049
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,333
Quiet, you!

1050
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:43,667
[laughing]

1051
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,875
What is that unholy
sound? Stop! Stop!

1052
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,167
Only if you swear…

1053
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,875
[whispering] On your
Hylurgian honor.

1054
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,917
Oh. On your Hylurgian honor

1055
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,042
to leave the Communiverse
in peace and never return.

1056
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,250
My Hylurgian honor?

1057
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,250
Do you know what you are asking?

1058
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,500
-I will…
-[laughing]

1059
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,208
[groaning]

1060
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,208
Stop!

1061
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,083
I-I concede!

1062
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,083
I swear on my honor…

1063
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:14,333
[all gasp]

1064
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,708
You are full of surprises.

1065
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:17,958
You have my vow.

1066
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,708
I will come to collect my son,

1067
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:25,417
but if even one hair on
a single nub is harmed,

1068
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,083
you will feel my wrath.

1069
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,875
Well done. I knew
you had it in you.

This isn't the life you wanted.

1440
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:25,167

Yeah, and he needs our help.
You have clearance, right?

Not for this.
