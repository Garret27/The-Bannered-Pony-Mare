00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,427
 Citizens of Oz,

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,596
there have been 12 tide turns

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,015
since the Wicked Witch
of the West escaped

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,892
with our Grimmerie.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,769
Shield your children.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,147
Trust no animals.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,689
She will be eliminated.

8
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,611
Until then, the Wizard's vision

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,698
for the Oz of tomorrow
marches on.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,202
Do it! Move!

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,331
All right, load it up.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,126
Come on! Let's go! Move!

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,919
No speaking.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,878
The Wizard needs
the road finished.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,013
Move! Move!

16
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,557
Come on, let's go! Move!

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,767
Fill up that basket!

18
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,941
Keep moving.

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,233
Come on.

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,655
Come on. Keep moving.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,449
Get up!

22
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,956
Come on.

23
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,760
Whoa. Settle down.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,185
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

25
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,525

Retreat! Guards, retreat!

27
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,327

if you want to attend,
next week.

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,868
Oh. Perhaps.

98
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,161
Uh, The Quadling Quorum
wants to honor you.

99
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,329
They're just not sure
for what yet.

100
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,330
Good to hear.

101
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,249
And someone sent pastries.

102
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,584
Good for us.

103
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,460
Hey, send these
to my hovel, please.

104
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,337
The gowns from last week?

105
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,047
Oh, maybe, uh, give
to the under-fortunate.

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,966
Oh, of course.
Good idea.

107
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,384
And, you know,

108
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,635
while we're at it,
we really should

109
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,470
look into trademarking
the word "good."

110
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,639
-Ooh. That's go...
-Ooh.

111
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,266
I mean, I'm goosified.

112
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,892
My follicles are screaming.

113
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,645
-I love my job so much.
-Aw. Good.

114
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,606
Madame Morrible.

115
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,149
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

116
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,150
I had no idea.

117
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,362
Has something happened?
Is it Elphaba?

118
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,072
You mean the Wicked Witch?

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,365
Right, of course.

120
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,659
-Come in, come in.
-Mrs. Morrible...

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,244
Would you like us
to take minutes for you?

122
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,163
...I c... I can, I can get you,
like, a little snack.

123
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,414
You want a little snack?

124
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,916
Like a cherry frazzle
or a juice puff?

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,752
"Mrs. Morrible"?

126
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,128
She's not married.

127
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,255
You sh...

128
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,257
With the Yellow Brick Road

129
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,760
grand opening ahead
and the Wicked Witch attacks

130
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,180
growing bolder,
the public is on edge.

131
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,182
So it's more important than ever

132
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,143
that you lift
everyone's spirits,

133
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,271
as only you can.

134
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,647
Accordingly.

135
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,153
Oh, Madame, I love it.

136
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,280
What is it?

137
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,199
Your new mode of transport.

138
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,119
Your very own
vehicular spherical globule.

139
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,038
So, like, a bubble?

140
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,668
Sure.

141
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,135
Was that supposed to happen?

142
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,012
It's all right.

143
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,722
Are you sure?

144
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,932
Wha...

145
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,896
Does that do
what I think it does?

146
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,275
No!

147
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,032
I can't.

148
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,617
No way!

149
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,873
I'm obsessulated.

150
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,793
The Wizard had it crafted
especially for you.

151
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:49,005
His Ozness feels it vital
that you, as our Good Witch,

152
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,674
also be airborne.

153
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,134
I agree.

154
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,680
But don't fret over
your inability

155
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,682
to produce any actual magic.

156
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,060
This invention will
disguise your deficiency.

157
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,856
The bubble's mechanism
is cleverly concealed.

158
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,526
People will assume that
you are causing it to float

159
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,611
through your own witchly powers.

160
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,948
So, just let them assume.

161
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,742
Right.

162
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,117
But don't forget this.

163
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,633
The wand really sells it.

164
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,973
I'll see you
at the opening ceremony.

165
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,058
Thank you so much.

166
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,118
A magic wand?

167
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,703
Happy birthday, Galinda.

168
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,459
It's what I've wanted
most of all.

169
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
Come on, give it a go.

170
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,922
Yeah, try it out!

171
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,842
Magic! Magic!
Magic! Magic! Magic!

172
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,718
Come on.

173
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,442
Oh.

174
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,819
I forgot to say the spell.

175
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,237
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

176
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,572
The wand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:44,037
I hereby commandify that
something magical shall happen!

178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,997
She can't even make a spark.

179
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,000
Look! There's a rainbow.

180
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
Wow.

181
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,005
Did you make that?

182
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,131
Um...

183
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,301
Well, you know
how I love rainbows.

184
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,843
Oh, wow!

185

POPSICLE Go see the rainbow!

187
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,311
Isn't it fantastic?

188
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,064
Who is ready for some cake?

189
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,025
Go see Rosie and Posie.

190
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,490
What's wrong, dearest?

191
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,825
You got everything you wanted.

192
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,370
I know,
but I want to be magical.

193
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,496
For real.

194
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,332
And... I'm not.

195
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,170

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,570
Come with me, dearest.

00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,908
What is going on?

265
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,451
People are watching.

266
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,953
I can't just
stand there grinning,

267
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,246
pretending to go along
with all this.

268
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,081
Do you think
I like hearing them say

269
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,582
those awful things about her?
I hate it.

270
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,085
Then what are we doing here?
Let's go. Let's go.

271
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,586
-Let's just get out of here.
-I-I can't.

272
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,964
I can't when there are
people looking to me

273
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,715
to raise their spirits.

274
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,179
You can't leave
because you can't resist this.

275
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,306
That's the truth.

276
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,352
Well, maybe I can't.

277
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,856
Is that so wrong?

278
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,941
I mean, who could?

279
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,943
Well, you know who could.

280
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,112
We both know
who could and who has.

281
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,530
And I have to find her,

282
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,157
because if someone else
gets there first, she...

283
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,117
Fiyero, I'm worried
for her, too.

284
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,870
And I miss her.

285
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,664
Can't you see
she doesn't want to be found?

286
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,293
You've got to face it.

287
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,419
She's made her choice.

288
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,721
You're right.

289
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,105
And, look...

290
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,109
...if it makes you happy,
of course I'll marry you.

291

It'll make you happy,
too, right?

00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,126
Even you.

368
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,125
Madam Governor?

369
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,837
That proposed new regulation,
the Animal Anti-Motility law.

370
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,004
What law?

371
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,092
Animals would need
a permit to travel.

372
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,594
Munchkinland is the one place

373
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,346
in Oz it hasn't been ratified.

374
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,097
The League of Governors
is urging you to sign.

375
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,100
Nessa, you're not
going to sign that.

376
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,770
But if I don't...

377
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,022
people will say,
"She's just like her sister."

378
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,530
Give us a clock-tick, Avaric.

379
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,375
Boq, forgive me.

380
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:46,128
It's just that Elphaba
abandoned me when I needed her.

381
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,547
She didn't even come see me
when Father died.

382
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,674
Only you did that.

383
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,011
Oz only knows how I'd have coped

384
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,931
with all of this without you.

385
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,238
And I'm glad
I could be there for you.

386
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,870
But I've been thinking
for a while now...

387
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,121
Yes?

388
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,833
I think it's time I moved on.

389
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,924
I see.

390
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,556
Well, if that's how you feel,

391
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,891
I think it's best you leave.

392
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,811
Now.

393
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,991
Nessa, this won't be the
last time we'll see each other.

394
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,202
Oh, I know.

395
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,921
Attention, passengers.

396
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,008
This is the final boarding
for the Emerald City Unlimited.

397
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,594
Doors will be closing shortly.

398
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:20,471
Please step inside and make way
for boarding passengers.

399
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,067
Visiting someone special?

400
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,486
Get a new Ozfit.

401
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,738
Visit the Wizard's Emporium
in downtown Emerald City.

402
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,948
Next.

403
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,241
Oh.

404
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,702
Excuse me.
Um, my train is boarding in...

405
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,662
Travel permit?

406
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,791
-What?
-All Munchkins are forbidden

407
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,375
to leave Munchkinland

408
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,295
without express written
permission of the Governor.

409
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,342
She insisted it go
into effect immediately.

410
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,513
...reminder to all passengers...

411
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,056
Stop pushing me.

412
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,641
-Elsa.
-Go!

413
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,100
-What's happening?
-Keep your hands off my family.

414
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,019
I don't want to hear it,
Munchkins.

415
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,771
Move! Forward now, Munchkins.

416
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,105
Go.

417
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,774
This is outrageous.

418
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,567
-You cannot treat us like this.
-Go!

419
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,860
Move along, Munchkins.

420
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,278
Next.

421
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,947
This is not the Oz I know.

422
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,448
-This is un-Ozian.
-Back in line.

423
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,408
Step back. What did I say?

424
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,119
Step... Munchkins, step back.

425
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,369
Back in line.

426
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,806
Watch your footing.

427
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,016
Next group. Come on, children.

428
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,560
Let's move.
We have to leave now.

429
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,144
Stay together!

430
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,647
Come along now.

431
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,732
Keep moving.

432
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,984
Eyes on your children, please.

433
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,491
Don't worry, I'm with you.
I'll never leave you.

434
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,076
Don't go too fast.

435
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,495
-What is all this?
-Watch your step.

436
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,830
What are you doing?

437
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,456
Come, children. Quickly.

438
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,624
We must get out of Oz.

439
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,002
Don't do this. Please.

440
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,962
-Keep moving.
-Don't leave Oz.

441
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,631
Join with me.
Help me fight the Wizard.

442
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,551
And wait for
the monkeys to carry us off?

443
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,012
That's what happens
to animals who speak out.

444
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,680
And they're never seen again.

445
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,724
No.

446
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,392
Oz wouldn't be Oz
without all of you.

447
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,729
And I know you're frightened,
but this is home.

448
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,439
Belongs to all of us.

449
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,398
Elphaba.

450
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,738
Dulcibear.

451
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,447
Oh, little one.

452
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,617
I've missed your bear hugs.

453
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,748
We can't stay here.

454
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,916
It's become rotten.

455
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,586
There's only one thing left
for us to do:

456
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:01,842
escape through that tunnel
to The Place Beyond Oz.

457
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,388
They say The Place Beyond Oz
is just...

458
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,765
...emptiness.

459
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,689
How will you survive?

460
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,608
How will you survive here?

461
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:22,737
No one in Oz will be happy
until you're dead.

462
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,834
Why would you want to stay?

463
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,840

At night, when I close my eyes,

509
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:09,004
I still see that green face.

510
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,635
I can't believe it. Is that you?

511
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,095
Stay back!

512
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,722
When I was just a cub,

513
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,808
she snatched me from
the only home I ever knew.

514
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,143
You were in a cage.

515
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,477
If I'd have left you there,

516
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,188
you would never
have learned to speak.

517
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,065
They say she's the one
who gave the monkeys wings

518
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,817
and gave the Wizard his spies.

519
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,653
Is this true?

520
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,117
It's true.

521
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,160
I cast that spell.

522
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,871
And I have to live with that.

523
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,210
If I'd have known
I was being tricked,

524
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,170
if I'd have known why,
I would never have...

525
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,838
The Wizard lies.

526
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,507
I can prove it.
And if we stand together...

527
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,508
Dulcibear!

528
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,843
Little one,

529
00:34:54,926 --> 00:35:00,140
I know you'll keep fighting,
because I know you.

530
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,195
Thank you, Boq.

531
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,965
Perhaps a friendly game
of cards once I'm done working?

532
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,884
Whatever you say,
Madam Governor.

533
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,095
I asked you to call me Nessa.

534
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,138
Remember?

535
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,599
Boq.

536
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,146
Never mind. I'll call you
when I've finished.

537
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,305
Now, who could have left
that door open?

538
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,647
I did.

539
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,116
It's so good to see you.

540
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,451
Why are you here?

541
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,622
I've tried to keep you
out of all of this, but...

542
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,459
I need you.

543
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,294
Thought you might have come
to apologize.

544
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,212
Apologize?

545
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,922
Our father died of shame,

546
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,508
and you didn't even bother
to show up.

547
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,427
You might at least
pretend to be sorry.

548
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,429
For what? He hated me.

549
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,264
That's a Wicked thing to say.

550
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,849
No, it's not.

551
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,392
It's just the truth.

552
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,769
Do you know why?

553
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,645
What does it matter now?

554
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,231
You're right.

555
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,276
Doesn't matter.

556
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,945
Because it's just us.

557
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,739
You're the Governor.
People will listen to you,

558
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,824
-and together, we...
-Why should I help you?

559
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,494
You fly around Oz
with that book,

560
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,496
helping animals
you've never even met,

561
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,164
and not once
have you ever thought

562
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,833
-to use your powers to help me.
-You never wanted my help.

563
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,460
I do now!

564
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,971
I want to go back to the way
we were at school.

565
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:49,099
That night when Boq told me
I was beautiful.

566
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,731
It was the first time
I ever wore these shoes.

567
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,233
There was music.

568
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,408

still possible.

The little that's left of it.

628
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,277

your heart to me, I tell you!

...magic spell you.

632
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,831
There must be a magic spell
in here to capture your heart.

633
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,250
-Nessa, no. That's dangerous.
-What is she doing?

634
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,752

all wrong!

-Wh-What is she saying?
-"Ah tum, ta tayk."

638
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,011
I'm going.

00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,941

like it's shrinking.

643
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,985
-Do something!
-I can't!

644
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,029
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

645
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,073
Boq? This is all your fault!

646
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,991
-If you hadn't come here...
-I have to find another spell.

647
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,618

All the most influential people
in Oz will be there.

667
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,412
It's the perfect opportunity
to show them all the truth

668

about the Wizard.

Nessa, I have done
everything I could for you,

672
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,299
and it hasn't been enough.

673
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,801
Nothing ever will be.

674
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,306
Elphaba, don't leave me!

675
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,895
Goodbye, Nessa.

676
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,896
I'm off to see the Wizard.

677
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,703
Where am I?

678
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,996
What happened?

679
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,415
It's all right, dearest.

680
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,790

681
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,270
What have you done?

682
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,943
It wasn't me.

683
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,485
I tried to stop her.

684
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,663
Boq, please.

685
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,793
What have you done to me?

686
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,461
You witch!

687
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,754

688
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,713

690
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,901
MADAME MORRIBLE
Ozians of the Emerald City,

691
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,987
today the winds shift

692
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,824

before our very eyes...

693
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,701
-Mm-hmm.

694
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,953

of our Wizard,

695
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,039

and Prince Fiyero Tigelaar

00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,917
join hands in unification.

697
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,210
Do I have everything I need?

698
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,170
No, I need an earring, please.

699
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,006
Thank you.

700
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,842
Something oldish? Yes.

701
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,385
This is
more than just a wedding.

702
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,595
It is a coronation
of hope itself.

703
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,267
Something new?

704
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,979
Absolutely.

705
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,189
So let the very foundations

706
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,067
of Oz shimmer

707
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,360
Let's go!

708
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,154
...for today,
Oz writes a new chapter.

709
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,156
Rejoicify,

710
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,075
and Oz shall shine forevermore.

711
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,457
Something bartered.

712
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,210
And something askew.
I need something askew.

713
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,344
Just give me a clock-tick.

714
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,484
Elphaba Thropp,
I know you're out here.

715
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,570
Just come in
before the monkeys spot you.

716
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,165
Elphaba.

717
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,999

720
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,523
Thank Oz you're alive.

721
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,483
Careful. Your dress.

722
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,962
I still can't believe you
get around on that old thing.

723
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,630
Well, we can't all
come and go by bubble.

724
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,130
True.

725
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,722
Are you all right?

726
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,473
I'm fine.

727
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,644
I just wanted
to come and see you.

728
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,312
That means a lot to me, Elphie.

729
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,898
But if anyone
discoverates you...

730
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,151
I know. I know.

731
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,405
You never saw me.

732
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,323
I was never here.
Do you understand?

733
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,451
No. I can't bear this anymore.

734
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,536
I'm taking you
to see the Wizard.

735
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,662
Absolutely not.

736
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,413
-Yes.
-No!

737
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,209
This is between
the Wizard and I.

738
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,545
I understand.
But you have to trust me.

739
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,172
I know how to talk to him,

740
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,353

742
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,119

You're done.

744
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,529
It's over.

745
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,951
I had a hunch
you'd be coming back to me.

746
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,703
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for Oz.

747
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,122
Elphaba.

748
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,081
You know, you could've
just exited normally.

749
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,750
Just use the door.

750
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,168
Hello?

751
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,754
-Yes?
-Don't hate me.

752
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,089
It's my wedding day,

753
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,049
and you cannot refuse
a wedding wish.

754
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,551
Well, you can, but it's rude.

755
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,511
I don't have time
for this. Now, listen.

756
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,096
You and I are gonna go
down there together,

757
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,681
and you are gonna admit
to her guests

758
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,099
that you have no real power

759
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,036
and that you cannot read
the Grimmerie.

760
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,313
Why is that funny?

761
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,316
Elphaba, uh, I've missed you.

762
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,570
Can't we start again?

763
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,654
Yes. Please.

764
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,281
-Just say yes.
-No.

765
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,241
Don't you think I wish I could?

766
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,244
I would give anything
to go back to a time when I...

767
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:45,001
...when I actually believed
that you were Wonderful.

768
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,045
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

769
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,714
No one believed in you
more than I did.

770
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,760
But there's no going back.

771
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,970
And we can't move forward,

772
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,471
not until everyone knows
what I know.

773
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,140
And once they know the truth...

774
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,267
They're not gonna believe it.

775
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,643
How can you say that?

776
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,228
Well, I'm just being straight
with you.

777
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,647
I could tell 'em
that I'd been lying to 'em

778
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,026
till I'm... forgive me...
blue in the face,

779
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,528
but wouldn't make
any difference.

780
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,656
They're never gonna stop
believing in me.

781
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,825

Your way hasn't worked.

904
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:57,867
locked in here, um,
for their own safety.

905
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,124
But, ah, no need
for that anymore.

906
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,542
Okay.

907
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,503
Hey, you want to come
over here and do the honors?

908
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:12,508
Uh, 'cause if you put that
in-in here, it'll let 'em go.

909
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,218
And, uh, I...

910
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,221
Gosh, I-I hope you feel good
about this whole thing, 'cause,

911
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,681
well, you've won,
but I think we all have.

912
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,201
Chistery.

913
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,208
Nothing can change
what's been done to you.

914
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,254
Well... what I've done.

915
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,341
But at least
you have your freedom now.

916
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,178
Chistery, can you speak?

917
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,057
Please try.

918
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,314
Well... go on.

919
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,983
You're free.

920
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,945
Fly.

921
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,792
Fly.

922
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:32,670
Fly!

923
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,683
Wonderful. Uh...

924
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,018
Well...

925
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,895
Hey, if you and I
are gonna go down there

926
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:52,274
and greet those fancy folks,
I'd better, uh, spruce up.

927
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,172
Chistery, what's wrong?

928
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,802
Dr. Dillamond.

929
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,808
Dr. Dillamond.

930
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,602
Can't you speak?

931
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,021
It's me, Elphaba.

932
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,949
Let me explain, 'cause th...

933
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,616
this is not what it looks like.

934
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:57,417
Elphaba, some animals
cannot be trusted.

935
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,085
Yes.

936
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,588
I know that now.

937
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,929
And these sacred vows

938
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,597
are to be entered into

939
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,392
not lightly but merrily.

940
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,438
Elphaba, try to understand.

941
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,190
No.

942
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:22,943
I'm not a bad man. I'm just a...

943
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,694
Yes, you are.
You're a very bad man.

944
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,078
You once asked me
what my heart's desire was,

945
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,497
and I know now what that is.

946
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,209
And that is to fight you
till the day I die!

947
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,176
Run.

948
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,559
Wha...

949
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,686
And do you, Glinda...

950
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,361
What is that horrendible sound?

951
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,670
Move!

952
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,263
Stay there.

953
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,601
Fiyero!

954
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,202
This is the work
of the Wicked Witch!

955
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,495
She wants to kill us all!

956
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,642
No...

957
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,098
How does it feel to have
your voice taken away?

958
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,067
Silence, Witch!

959
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:32,864
Water.

960
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,783
Lots of it. Bring water!

961
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:35,909
Yes, sir.

962
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,953
As much as you can carry.

963
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,330
A little help?

964
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,251
Ah.

965
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,671
Please.

966
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,717
Thank you.

967
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,345
That was, uh, unpleasant.

968
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,559
Well, I think my trachea

969
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:01,935
is otherwi...

970
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,979
What? What are you doing?

971
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,064
-Shush, you. Get in.
-What?

972
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,690
Get in.

973
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,985
Unless you want
the guests to know

974
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,653
the truth about their Wizard.

975
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,446
Get in!

976
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,406
Yes, yes.

977
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,554
Your Ozness!

978
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,641
Fiyero. What are you...

979
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,393
What is happening?

980
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,229
What's happened is that
these two traitors...

981
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,731
Not another word, Your Ozness.

982
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,025
Darling, have you misplaced
your mind?

983
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,818
What are you doing?

984
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,294
I'm going with her.

985
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,796
-What?
-What?

986
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,133
Let's go.

987
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,843
-What?
-Let's go.

988
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,928
Wait. What?

989
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:23,683
You mean to tell me
that the two of you...

990
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,811
-This whole time?
-No, it wasn't like that.

991
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,604
Go.

992
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,859
Now.

993
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,783
You deserve each other.

994
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,874
You frightened me.

995
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,418
For a while there,
I thought you changed.

996
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,550
I have changed.

997
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,477
This dulls the pain,
if you want a swig?

998
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,735
No, no, no, no!

999
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,072
No! No!

1000
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,240
We've got the water, Madame.

1001
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,075
Fools! You're too late.

1002
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,411
Get out!

1003
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,162
How could you let this happen?

1004
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,957
Uh, do you have a hairpin?

1005
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,166
Thanks.

1006
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,878
Uh, she and I had a deal.

1007
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,756
But, uh...

1008
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,841
she double-crossed me.

1009
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,511
We must smoke her out,

1010
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,180
force her to show herself.

1011
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,515
Uh, without the monkeys,

1012
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,850
I don't know
how we're gonna do that.

1013
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,728
Her sister.

1014
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,399
Use her sister.

1015
01:09:56,109 --> 01:10:01,323
Spread a rumor
that her sister's in trouble.

1016
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,200
She'll fly to her side,
and you'll have her.

1017
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,332
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to lie down.

1018
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,667
I have a bit of a headache.

1019
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,878
A rumor won't do.

1020
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,132
Elphaba's too smart.
That's right.

1021
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:23,011
These things must be
done delicately.

1022
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,221
Perhaps...

1023
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,639

Boq! Boq!

01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,024
Where are you?

01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,944

Stay calm.

1086
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,363
Move! Go!

1087
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,283
Boq!

1088
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,006
You can't go on living here.

1089
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,634
-They'll find you.
-I'll be all right.

1090
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,761
Listen.

1091
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,431
My family has a castle
in Kiamo Ko.

1092
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:50,351
-Never lived in it.
-Where do you live?

1093
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:52,687
In the other castle.

1094
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,313
Okay.

1095
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,190
-Of course.
-I mean, it's the perfect hideout.

1096
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,901
There's tunnels,
secret passageways.

1097
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,737
You'll be safer there.

1098
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,700
NESSAROSE Boq!

1099
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,160
-Where are you?
-What?

1100
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,245
Boq!

1101
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,374
Boq!

1102
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,209
What is it?

1103
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,585
What's wrong?

1104
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:23,425
This isn't gonna make
any sense, but...

1105
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,513
There's a house.

1106
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,890
And it's flying through the sky.

1107
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:45,531
Hey, hey, hey.

1108
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,949
My sister.

1109
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,576
-She's in danger. I have to get to her.
-What?

1110
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,494
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

1111
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,121
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:57,960
Will we ever see
each other again?

1113
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,427
Elphaba, we are going to be
together always.

1114
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,181
You can see houses
flying through the sky,

1115
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:12,474
but you can't see that?

1116
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,272
-This way, dear.
-Goodbye, Dorothy.

1117
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,440
Bye, Dodo.

1118
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:45,024
It's just that one road
the whole time.

1119
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,238
Take your time.
Hurry up, darling.

1120
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,646
Goodbye, Nessa.

1121
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,451
-What a touching display of grief.
-Oh, shiz.

1122
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:38,495
I scare you?

1123
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,790
I seem to have
that effect on people.

1124
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,795
I would appreciate a moment
to say goodbye to my sister.

1125
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,171
Alone.

1126
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,464
Of course.

1127
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,233
Oh, Nessa.

1128
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,071
Forgive me.

1129
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,156
Oh, Elphaba,
don't blame yourself, please.

1130
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,075
It's dreadful, it is.

1131
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,704
I mean...
to have a house fall on you...

1132
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,999
But accidents will happen.

1133
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,667
And...

1134
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,506
You call that an accident?

1135
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,220
You think cyclones just appear
out of the blue?

1136
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,471
I don't know.

1137
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:39,098
I never really thought
about it...

1138
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:40,933
And how dare you send
that mulish farm girl

1139
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,101
off to see the Wizard,

1140
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,894
as if he could do
anything to help?

1141
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,771
She's lost. She's far from home.

1142
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,606
She took a dead woman's shoes.

1143
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,858
I had to do something.

1144
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,943
I'm a public figure now.
People expect me to...

1145
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:51,986
Lie?

1146
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,488
Be encouraging.

1147
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,782
Those shoes are all
I have left of my sister.

1148
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,034
They weren't yours to give.

1149
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:05,040
Yes, well, it seems
a lot of us are taking things

1150
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,709
that don't belong to us now,
aren't we?

1151
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,963
No, you just wait a clock-tick.

1152
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,631
It might be hard for you
to comprehend

1153
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,552
that someone like him
could choose someone like me,

1154
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,763
but it's happened,
and it's real.

1155
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,808
And you can wave that
ridiculous wand all you want.

1156
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,268
You can't change it.

1157
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,146
He never belonged to you.

1158
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,773
He doesn't love you.

1159
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,609
He never did.

1160
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:32,776
He loves me.

1161
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,821
Oh, my...

1162
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,122
Feel better?

1163
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:47,416
I do.

1164
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,709
Good.

1165
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,256
Me, too.

1166
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,469
Are you crazy?

1167
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,016
Excuse me.
What do you think you're doing?

1168
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:07,394
Come on!
Come on! Bring it!

1169
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:08,728
Get back!

1170
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,194
Get... Oh! Oh!

1171
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,778
Let's go!

1172
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,742
You...

1173
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,747
Please.

1174
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,665
Where'd you get that?

1175
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,129
What are you doing?

1176
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,638
Come on. Let's go, greenie!

1177
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:43,929
Use your hands!

1178
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,142
Come on!

1179
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,435
-Bring it on!
-You're out of your mind!

1180
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,645
-Get off of me!
-No! -

1181
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:51,397
Attention!

1182
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,898
-Halt in the name of the Wizard!
-Oh, come on!

1183
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,441
-Off of me!
-Ow! Ow! -Let her go.

1184
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:55,734
No, no, no, no.
I almost had her.

1185
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,904
I almost had her.

1186
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,406
Easy.

1187
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,977
Sorry it took us so long
to get here, Your Goodness.

1188
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,495
You were a part of this?

1189
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,080
-Elphaba, no...
-I can't believe

1190
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,666
you would stoop so low
as to use my sister's death

1191
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:11,750
to capture me.

1192
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,419
I never meant to take it
this far. I...

1193
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:16,004
Let the green girl go.

1194
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,591
Else explain to all Oz
how the Wizard's guards

1195
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,343
watched while
Glinda the Good was slain.

1196
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,863
-Elphaba, go.
-No. Not without you.

1197
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,489
Go!

1198
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:44,950
Go.

1199
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,785
I...

1200
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,414
Now.

1201
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,210
Go.

1202
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,478
Please, protect her.

1203
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,178
No! You're hurting him!
Stop it now!

1204
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,013
Stop it.

1205
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,559
In the name of Goodness, stop!

1206
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,186
Can't you see
he wasn't going to harm me?

1207
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,770
He just...

1208
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,485
He loves her.

1209
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,529
Glinda, I am so sorry.

1210
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,697
Take him out to that field.

1211
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,824
What? No, please.

1212
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,450
Put him up on those poles
till he tells us

1213
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,743
-where the Witch went.
-You're hurting him. No.

1214
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:12,204
Fiyero! No! Please!
Let go of me!

1215

Miss Glinda.

1525

It was a keepsake.

1529
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:32,676
She told me herself.

1530
01:55:32,759 --> 01:55:34,343
It belonged to her mother.

1531
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:38,306
This belonged to...

1532
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:41,101
...her mother?

1533
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:24,353
So Elphaba was yours all along.

1534
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:27,272
That's why she had such powers.

1535
01:56:27,355 --> 01:56:29,733
She was a child of both worlds.

01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:31,817
Oh, my Lord.

1537
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:35,363
What have I done?

1538
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:41,120
You have caused great harm.

1539
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:43,330
Which is why
you will be leaving Oz.

1540
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:45,123
Today.

1541
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:53,423
Did you hear what I said?

1542
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:57,010
And what...
what will I tell people?

1543
01:56:57,093 --> 01:56:59,137
Make something up.

1544
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,390
You're good at that.

1545
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:26,790
Excuse me.

1546
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:28,333
Hello.

1547
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:31,128
What? What do you want?

1548
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:33,296
Look out your window.

1549
01:57:34,756 --> 01:57:36,008
Come on.

1550
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:38,217
You don't want to miss this.

1551
01:57:43,348 --> 01:57:45,475
Excuse me, please.
Don't leave without us.

1552
01:57:45,558 --> 01:57:47,102
Please. I-I want to go home.

1553
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:50,646
Ugh, I swear it never ends
with that girl.

1554
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:57,279
The Wizard is taking
a permanent leave of absence.

1555
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:04,244
Not a rumor, a fact.

1556
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:06,579
The kind that is true.

1557
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,458
Glinda, dear.

1558
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:13,295
Can you not find it
in your heart t-to forgive me?

1559
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:16,632
As Oz is my witness,

1560
01:58:16,715 --> 01:58:20,468
I can see now
how truly good you are.

1561
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:24,514
Actually, I'm not.

1562
01:58:24,597 --> 01:58:26,475
Not yet.

1563
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:27,893
But just think, Madame.

1564
01:58:27,976 --> 01:58:31,438
We have so many cages,
and all recently vacated.

1565
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:33,190
You'll have your pick.

1566
01:58:33,273 --> 01:58:36,526
Although I can't imagine
you'll hold up very well.

1567
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:41,614
I mean, my personal opinion is
you do not have what it takes.

1568
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,826
I hope you prove me wrong.

1569
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:47,244
I doubt you will.

1570
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:50,649

I have much to attend to

1582
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:20,964
with the Wizard's
unexpected departure,

1583
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:25,469

Glinda.

1585
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:29,473

1586
02:00:29,556 --> 02:00:31,141

What?

1589
02:00:35,437 --> 02:00:38,355
Is it true you were her friend?

1590
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:43,695
Friend?

1591
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:46,613
Yes.

1592
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:50,659
I-I mean, I did know her.

1593
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:54,456
That is...

1594
02:00:54,539 --> 02:00:56,541
our paths did cross.

1595
02:01:02,046 --> 02:01:03,755
At school.

1596
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:13,016
Wait.

1597
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:17,603
I have something more to say.

1598
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,656
Fellow Ozians...

1599
02:01:53,097 --> 02:01:54,932
All Ozians.

1600
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:58,061
Yes, come out.

1601
02:01:58,144 --> 02:02:00,312
Wherever you are, come out.

1602
02:02:03,858 --> 02:02:04,983
Friends.

1603
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:11,114
Because I don't see
any enemies here.

1604
02:02:16,913 --> 02:02:19,666
We have been through
a frightening time.

1605
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:22,127
And there will be other times

1606
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,504
and other things
that frighten us.

1607
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,341
But if you'll let me...

1608
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:32,345
...I'd like to try to help.

1609
02:02:33,513 --> 02:02:35,056
To change things.

1610
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:43,522
I'd like to try to be
Glinda the Good.

1611
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:54,177
It worked.

1612
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,804
They all think you're dead.

1613
02:03:55,887 --> 02:03:57,513
Fiyero?

1614
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:04,937
See?

1615
02:04:06,648 --> 02:04:08,107
Good as new.

1616
02:04:19,452 --> 02:04:21,286
You saved my life.

1617
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:33,466
You're beautiful.

1618
02:04:35,635 --> 02:04:37,302
You don't have to lie to me.

1619
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:41,015
It's not lying.

1620
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:44,769
It's...

1621
02:04:44,852 --> 02:04:47,730
It's looking at things
in another way.

1622
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:50,191
Time to go.

1623
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:36,028
I wish that Glinda
could know we're alive.

1624
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:42,577
But I know she can't.

1625
02:05:44,871 --> 02:05:46,831
No one can ever know.
