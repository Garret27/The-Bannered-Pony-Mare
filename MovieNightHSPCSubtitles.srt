is the Slayer,

she who bears the birthmark,
the mark of the coven.

6
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,962
Trained by the Watcher,
one Slayer dies

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,131
and the next is chosen.

8
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,134

a hard time.

"You have
no sense of history."

00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,354
all helpless
and vulnerable...

170
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,857
Well, the weather
hasn't disappointed us.

171
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,193
Constant sun
and temperatures
in the high 70s

172
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,112
have made every
winter's day a beach day.

173
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,496
[Snarling]

174
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,834
[Grunts]

175
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,006
[Snarling]

176
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,475
[Groans]

177
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,317
Oh, please!
Show me a real Slayer.

178
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,777
Lothos.

179
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:34,198
Will you people never learn
we can't be stopped?

180
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,328
[Laughs]

181
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,790
[Thunderclap]
This is our world now.

182
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,842
Wow.

183
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,017
[Sighs]

184
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,144
Mmm.

185
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,067
Sleep, my master, my own.
Sleep.

186
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,779
I have already begun
building you a new family.

187
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,156
Soon we will be legion.

188
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,868
When you rise,
we will claim
this place as our own.

189
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,746
Rubies will drip
from your lips.

190
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,549
Soon.

191
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,011
The environment,
I'm telling you,
it's totally key.

192
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,179
The Earth is in
terrible shape.
We could all die.

193
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,016
Besides, Sting's doing it.
I thought he was
doing Indians.

194
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,019
How about
the homelesses?
Um, move.

195
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,230
Aren't there
any sicknesses that
aren't too depressing?

196
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,481
Hi.
Hey there.

197
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,774
What you guys doing?

198
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,402
Senior dance. We need to
come up with a theme.

199
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,738
A socially conscious theme.

200
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,158
Yeah. "One that reflects
the students' growing
awareness of,

201
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,410
and involvement in,
the world around them."

202
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,079
[Jeffrey, Andy]
Downer!

203
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,832
I still say the environment.
That's my suggestion.

204
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,168
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, that's
a good one.

205
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,295
What are the most
immediate threats

206
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,797
to the world environment
right now?

207
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,343
Um, litter?
[Andy] Litter. Yeah.

208
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,094
Forest fires?

209
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,679
Bugs?

210
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,265
Bugs. Totally.
Yeah, I hate bugs.

211
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,143
Yeah.
[Andy]
Cassandra, write it down.

212
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,064
Guys, what do you think
about the ozone layer?
[School Bell Rings]

213
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,899
Yeah.
What about it?
What?

214
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,110
Yeah, we gotta get
rid of that.
First bell, people.

215
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,446
Time marches on.

216
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,199
What's your point?
Button it, Kramer.

217
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,076
[Cassandra]
Let's meet tonight, okay?

218
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,994
Café Blasé?
Oh, cool.

219
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,372
We can, like, figure
decorations and stuff.
Yeah.

220
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,958
I don't know, guys.
I really wanna get
a head start on my homework.

221
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,630
[Laughing]
I love that one.

222
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,634
[Jukebox: Reggae Pop]

223
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,805
Buff, I don't see
why we have to invite
every single senior.

224
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,101
Because it's a senior dance.
Just a shot in the dark.

225
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,061
[Jennifer] So?
My usual.

226
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,106
[Nicki] Like, why do we
have to invite Nadia?
She's such a blemish.

227
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,483
I know.
You're right.
She is.

228
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,068
Hi.

229
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,364
What?

230
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,241
I thought that look was over.

231
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,827
Well, it's retro.

232
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,328
Yeah, retro.

233
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,373
You can
borrow it sometime.

234
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,083
Okay, maybe I will.

235
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,211
We were talking
about the senior dance,
in case you're interested.

236
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,588
[Whispering]
You guys,
look who's coming.

237
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,384
Ew. Make me sick. Ugh.

238
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,304
[Girls Laughing]

239
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,224
What does it look like?

240
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,188
Two coffees
or a hot dog.

241
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,441
[Waitress] Nothing on it.
Nothing inside.

242
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,733
[Quietly] Losers.

243
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,236
I'm Charlotte.
I'll be your waitress.

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Thanks, Charlotte.

245
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,366
You guys are thrashed.

246
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,452
[Girl] Just a little.
Are we?

247
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,287
[Girls Laughing]

248
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,081
That would explain
the slurred speech.

249
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,209
Thanks.
What's your name?

250
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,838
Buffy.

251
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,548
Yeah, it figures.

252
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,510
I'm Pike.

253
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,762
This is Benny.

[Clicks Teeth]

255
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,727
And I'm... I'm... Pike.

256
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,521
Pike isn't a name.
It's a fish.

257
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,523
[Laughing]

258
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,026
Don't we know you guys?

259
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,861
Hey, wait a minute.

260
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,489
You're the guys
from the movie.

261
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,741
We hate you guys.

262
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,202
Like we care, I'm sure.

263
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,162
Yeah. Boo-hoo.

[Girls Laughing]

265
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,292
[Muffled]
You guys were very rude,
okay? It was shocking.

266
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,294
You just
snuck in anyway.

267
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,629
Yeah.

268
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,424
Hey, Buffy. You hungry?
I got something for ya.

269
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,009
[Girls Shriek]

270

[Slicing]

271
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,057
Oh, man, she wasted my dog.

272
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,100
[Groans]

273
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,648
[Pike]
I'll have it running
in about a week.

274
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,733
All I need is
some brake pads,

275
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,278
shocks, some tires,
new engine, maybe.

276
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,696
[Benny]
It'll be totally cherry.

277
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,242
When you get that car
together, man, let's bail,
get out of this town.

278
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,203
Those rich bitches,
they're a plague.
They gotta be stopped.

279
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,372
What, you didn't like 'em?
Give me that.

280
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,959
They're all the same.
They're just so stuck-up.

281
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,212
It's like they're
not even human.
I hate 'em.

282
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,381
Yeah,
but would you bone 'em?

283
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,926
Yes, definitely.
Definitely. Please, God.
Especially the blonde.

284
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,554
Ooh, I'd give
my right eye
for a piece of that.

285
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,265
Wait.
She's not even human.

286
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,434
Yes, but her yabos
scoff at gravity.

287
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,019
Oh, man,
you're disgusting.

288
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,523
You don't even like her
and you'd sleep with her.
What is that?

289
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,360
I got a news flash for you.
Another shot of this,
and I'll have sex with you.

290
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,363
Oh, yeah.
Then you'll never call me.

291
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,535
[Benny Groaning]

292
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,997
I think I'm gonna ralph.

293
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,874
Oh, hey, Benny,
I'm here for you, man.

294
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,335
I'm here.
[Laughs]

295
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,255
I'm here for you, Ralph.

00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,595

[Sinister laughter]

300
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,948
This is not
a very safe place
for you to fall asleep.

301
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,744
Okay, Mom.
[Grunts]

302
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,204

303
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,625

Okay, dribble.

[Singing]
Shoot, shoot

305
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,838
Take that ball
to the hoop, hoop

306
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,132
All right. Yeah.
That's cute.
I like that.

307
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,300
Bye.
See ya.

308
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,137
I was thinking,
for the senior dance,
what if we made a big sign

309
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,973
that says,
"Don't Tread on Me"?

310
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,475
You know,
on a picture of the Earth.

311
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,104
How do you not
tread on the Earth?
You kind of have to, right?

312
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,442
Oh. Yeah, I never
thought of that. Yeah.

313
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,818
I gotta bail.
You coming?

314
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,820
No. You guys blow.
I'm waiting on Cassandra.

315
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,615
She's gonna help me
with my history.
Wait, wait, wait.

316
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,203
[Sighs]
I kind of loaned her
Kimberly's yellow leather

317
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,498
jacket, so don't tell her,
all right?

318
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,083
Okay, I won't.
See ya.

319
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,250
Bye.

320
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,016
[Gasps]
God!

321
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,687
You scared me to death.
Where the hell
did you come from?

322
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,357
That was very impressive,
the... the... the tumbling.

323
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,692
What?

324
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh. I used
to do gymnastics.

325
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,489
Are you looking
for somebody?

326
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,825
I was looking
for you actually.

327
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,329
Why? Am I in trouble
or something? 'Cause if
I am, I didn't do it.

328
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,874
[Chuckles]
No, you're not in trouble.
I am. I'm years late.

329
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,751
You should have
been taught, prepared.

330
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,796
But I wasn't certain
until just now
that it was you.

331
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,048
What are you
talking about?

332
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,385
I'm saying that I've been
searching everywhere
for you, Buffy.

333
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,012
Why?

334
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,598
To bring you
your birthright.

335
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,392
My birthright?

336
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,061
Is... Is that like
a trust fund
or something?

337
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,816
I think it will be easier
for you to understand
this birthright

338
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,901
if I show it to you.

339
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,903
All right?

340
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,365
So you come with me now
to the graveyard.

00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,242
[Groans]

342
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,328
No. No, no, no.

343
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,081
My trust fund's
in the graveyard?

344
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,417
God, what's your damage?

345
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,210
Buffy?

346
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,671
[Exhales]
You're one of those
skanky old men

347
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,007
that attacks little girls
and stuff, right?

348
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,759
Well, forget you.

349
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,846
My name is Merrick,
and you have been
chosen, Buffy.

350
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,600
[Exhales]
Chosen to go
to the graveyard?

351
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,603
Why don't you just take
the first runner-up, okay?

352
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,563
Everything depends
on you, Buffy.

353
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,484
You must come with me now
to the graveyard
while there's still time.

354
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,569
Time to do what?

355
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,782
Time to stop the killing,
to stop the vampires.

356
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,368
All right. Let me
get this straight, okay?

357
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,122
You want me to go
to the graveyard with you

358
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,043
because I'm the "Chosen One"
and there are vampires?

359
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,878
Yes.

360
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,714
Does Elvis talk to you?

361
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,633
Does he tell you
to do things?

362
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,885
Do you see spots?

363
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,553
Spots?

364
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,973
Yes, of course.
That's your proof.

365
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,892
Spots.

366
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,520
You bear the mark.

367
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,396
You bear the mark
of the coven.

368
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,565
What, that big
old hairy mole?

369
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,818
Ew. I had
that thing removed.

370
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,321
Besides, you knowing
about my big old mole
doesn't prove anything.

371
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,450
Except for it's
way past medication time
for you, buddy.

372
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,202
So why don't you just
stay away from me, okay?

373
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,329
Do you ever dream
that you were
someone else, Buffy?

374
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,622
Everybody does.

375
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,165
No, someone in the past.

376
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,709
Someone real.

377
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,920
A Magyar
peasant girl perhaps.

378
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,214
An Indian princess?

379
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,091
A slave?

380
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,429
I was a slave.

381
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,931
In Virginia.

382
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,308
I... I don't know.

383
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,811
There was, like, this
big farm or something.

384
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:54,359
There was this one
where there were
these knights and I'm a...

A servant girl.
A barmaid.

Oh, my God.

387
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,288
Oh, my God.
I never told anybody
about this.

388
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,665
There's this one
where there's this man.

389
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,585
I think he's a man.
He's in my dreams sometimes.

390
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,256
I'm fighting him...
Always fighting him.
[Laughs]

391
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,341
But he's so strong.

392

His name is Lothos.

How do you know
all this?

394
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,729
Because it is your birthright,
and I am a part of it.

395
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,941
You come with me
to the graveyard,

396
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,819
and I will show you.

I can't believe
I'm doing this.

00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,246
I can't believe
I'm in a graveyard
with a strange man,

400
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,583
hunting for vampires
on a school night.

401
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,668
Ew.

402
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,505
Why did you never tell anyone
about your dreams?

403
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,635
Oh, right.
Tell everybody I'm crazy?
Beauty idea.

None of your
business. God!
This is it.

Robert Berman was killed
three days ago,

408

and his body was found
in the bushes by the canal.

Wait a minute.
No, no. You won't
have to do anything.

They're just
for your protection.
Sit there.

All right.
What do we do now?

We wait
for Robert Berman to wake up.

like 50 times.

you go to school tomorrow
and act normally.

459

Don't let anyone know
you know what's happening.
This is important.

460
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,204
Because once the vampires
find out who you are,

461
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,082
you won't be
hunting them anymore.

462

They mustn't know
your name.

to have to skip it.

this thing was slow.

Listen, I think there's been
a big mistake, all right?

I appreciate that there are
real vampires and that you're
on this big holy mission,

but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong
'cause I'm not your girl.

I'm up to it.

neither do you.

there's anything more
for us to say.

00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,948
You... You... You threw
a knife at my head.

516
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,950
Yes. I had to show you.

517
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,579
But you threw
a knife at my head.

518
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,500
And you caught it.
Only the Chosen One
could have caught it.

519
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,586
Don't you get it?
I don't want to be
the Chosen One.

520
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,507
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life
chasing after vampires.

521
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,677
All I want to do
is graduate from high school,

522
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,346
go to Europe,
marry Christian Slater
and die.

523
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,976
It may not sound too exciting
to a scone-head like you,
but I think it's swell.

524
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,062
You come along
and tell me I'm a member
of the hairy mole club,

525
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,314
so you can
throw things at me?

526
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,025
Buffy, it was necessary.

527
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,696
Last night,
you knew I was sitting
in a fresh grave, didn't you?

528
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,449
Yes, because I had
to make you aware
of the implica...

529
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,616
[Groans]

530
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,410
Oh. Wow.

531
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,871
[Groaning]

532
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,039
I...
I never hit anybody before.

533
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,877
[Muffled]
Really?
Well, you did it perfectly.

534
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,796
I didn't even break a nail.

535
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,341
[Pop Intro]

536
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,058
Yeah
[Grunting]

537
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,398
Yeah

538
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,360
I admit you got
the biggest brown eyes
[Yelling]

539
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:26,073
And you know how to bite
your lips to tantalize

540
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,450
Sure

541
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,952
Yeah

542
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:34,081
You can get any girl
you want going
And you do it

543
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,044
And don't say you don't know
'cause you do

544
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:44,759
Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

545
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,846
I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

546
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:53,351
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

547
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,311
So quit it

548
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,360
I love you, I love you
I do, boy

549
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,447
But you ain't
gonna cheat on me

550
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,867
I need you, I need you
I do, boy

551
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:17,583
Choose
Is it her or me?

552
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,960
[Yells]
Yeah

553
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,131
Just 'cause I
have a say input

554
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:30,054
You should be ashamed
of what I've been seeing

555
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,889
Yeah

556
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:36,269
You better watch
your step or, boy,
you're gonna lose

557
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,606
The best thing
you ever had

558
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,900
Oh, oh

559
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,821
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

560
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,658
[Yelling]
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

561
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,537
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

562
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,540
So quit it
Ha!

563
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,003
[Fades]

564
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,964
The heart.
Remember?

565
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,301
So when do I meet
this guy Lothos?

566
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,760
I don't know.

567
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:14,390
When he comes to you
in your dreams,
what does he do to you?

568
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,850
How does he make you feel?

569
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,022
He, uh...
He scares me.

570
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,610
Well, I think
we can safely say

571
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,154
that there's something
going on with you, Buffy.

572
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:34,118
Now, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

573
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,746
You're not
in any kind of trouble.

574
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,751
Don't think of me
as Gary Murray,
administrator.

575
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:46,672
No. Think of me
as Gary Murray, party guy,

576
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,300
a happenin' dude
who can talk to the young.

577
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,055
So tell me.
It's drugs, isn't it?

578
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,723
Hey, I know where
you're coming from.

579
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,932
[Insect Buzzing]

580
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,102
Believe me, I've had
my drug experiences.

581
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,396
Oh, yeah.
I did a lot...

582
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,857
Well, some acid
in the '60s.

583
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,984
[Buzzing]
See, I was at a...

584
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,654
I was at
a Doobie Brothers concert,

585
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,658
and I could see
the music flowing into,
flowing into me.

586
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,035
It was bright red
and electric.

587
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,789
And I... I felt like
I was a big, uh,
a big toaster, you know?

588
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,708
[Buzzing]
And I thought, "Well,
maybe I am a toaster,

589
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,919
and we're all molecules."

590
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,381
My friend Melissa,
her head looked like
a big party balloon,

591
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,092
and that...
Boy, whoo-hoo,
that scared me.

592
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,802
[Buzzing Stops]

593
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,015
Then I, uh...
I... I started to freak out.

594
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,186
You said you'd have
the part by 2:00.

595
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,271
Christ, it's almost dark.

596
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,860
What nasty bug crawled
up your bungus? Where
the hell are you going?

597
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,029
I'm leavin', man.
I'm bailin' town.

This place has gotten
way too hairy.

Where the hell am I gonna
find a mechanic stupid enough
to work for my kind of money?

600
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,787
Seen Benny lately?

601
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,789
No.
[Grunts]

602
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,710
Hey. Why, you want me
to give him a message?

603
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:09,964
You should think
about leaving too, man.
Sell this place.

604
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,632
There's something
going on around here.

605
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,218
I don't know.
Something real weird.

606
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,265
Hey, what do you want me
to do if I see Benny?

607
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,808
Run.

608
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,071
Nice night for a walk.

609
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,080

really helpless

616
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,653
Wait.

617
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,364

622
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,558
Toaster-kicked him.

623
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,853
It was a trap, get it?
I led him in.

624
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,856
It was a blind alley,
get it?

625
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,567
If there'd been
any more of them,
you would be dead by now.

626
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,654
You must never forget
the cardinal rule, Buffy.

627
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,741
One vampire is a lot easier
to kill than 10.

628
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,577
Does the word "duh"
mean anything to you?

629
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,539
You felt sick, didn't you?

630
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,415
You had cramps?

631
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,668
Nice conversationalist.

632
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,753
Yeah, I felt them a little.

633
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,382
But I'm not due for
another couple of weeks, since
you're so hot on the subject.

634
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,008
Of course you're not.

635
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,761
It was a natural reaction
on the part of the Slayer.

636
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,681
A reaction
to their unnaturalness.

637
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,142
And you're going
to be able to use that
to track them.

638
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,519
Great.

639
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,896
My secret weapon
is P.M.S.

640
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,232
That's just terrific.
Thanks for telling me.

641
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,277
It's not a weapon.
It's an alert system.

642
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:41,073
Well, aren't we kung fu.
I don't see you out there
killing any vampires.

643
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,284
No, I play my part.

644
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:48,080
You can play
with your part all you want,
but it's my neck on the block.

645
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm out there
risking my life.

646
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,961
I'm risking my life,
and you're not
doing anything.

647
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:00,009
I train girls to be Slayers.

648
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,845
I have done so
for a hundred lives,

649
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,889
and I shall continue
to do so.

650
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,433
I am born each time
with the knowledge

651
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:11,770
that my purpose is
to prepare the Chosen One

652
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,272
for her battle.

653
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,899
I am not a Slayer,

654
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,152
and I must not interfere
even if I want to,

655
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:23,032
even if I think
that this time the girl

656
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,492
is truly exceptional.

657
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:33,417
So, uh, what...
What do you do?

658
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:39,006
I mean, you just keep on
living the same old life
over and over?

659
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,967
Yes. Yes, until...

660
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,262
What, until there aren't
any more vampires?
Then what?

661
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,723
Oh, then maybe
I'll go to heaven.

662
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,851
[Scoffs]
Or maybe you'll
just get a job.

663
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,606
Oh, a job.
I would have been
a wonderful boot-maker.

664
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,234
That is so dull.
I'm going to be a buyer.

665
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,986
Of what?

666
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,196
I don't know.

667
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,033
It's just a job I heard of.
It sounded pretty cool,
you know?

668
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,621
Buying, buyer, to buy.

669
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,498
I like that.

670
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,966
We should go to work.

671
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,220
Yeah. Quick,
before anybody has any fun.

672
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,224
Merrick, I'm not gonna
croak that easily.

673
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,060
I have something
that the other girls
didn't have.

674
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,396
And what
might that be, pray?

675
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,273
My keen fashion sense.

676
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,026
Oh, vampires
of the world, beware.

677
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,237
[Laughing]
Merrick, you made a joke.

678
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,239
That's good.

679
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,449
Are you all right?
Do you wanna lie down?

680
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,994
I know it hurts
for the first time, but...

681
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,288
it was a good joke.

Come on, baby.
This is for the money.

689
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,281
Make me proud. Come on.

690
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,408
[Cranking]
Okay, come on.

691
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,952

694
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,349

[Pike]
Oh, give me a break.

703
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,978
You ruined my new jacket.

704
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,564

Hi.
Uh...

708
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,465
Is that your van?
Yeah, it was, just
somebody jumped...

709

[Snarls]

710
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,771
[Vampire Groaning]

711
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,566
Interesting choice.

712
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,735
Last-minute decision.

713
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,904
Sorry about
your guitar.

714
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,740
Hey, you're
that weird guy.

715
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,494
Oh, yeah.

716
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,371
You've been hurt.
Oh, no.

717
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:25,209
You know what they say?
Any one you can walk
away from is a good...

718
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,669
You know
this guy?

719
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,296
Well, somewhat.

720
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,134
He's rather fond
of passing out
just as I happen by.

721
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,308
You doin' all right?
You okay?

722
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,645
Yeah, I'm good.
I, you know, kinda miss
my knees though.

723
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,064
You want some water
or anything?

724
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,858
Kitchen's in here.
Nope. Got it covered.

725

[Exhales]

726
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,791
So you do this a lot?
I mean, it's like
a hobby for you?

727
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,501
Ow! Not exactly.

728
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,547
They were vampires,
weren't they?

729
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:13,882
[Sighs]

730
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,096

God! Vampires.
Unbelievable.

[Ice Rattling]

732
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,685
You had a carful of stuff.
Were you leaving?

733
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,395
Yeah, I was bailin'.

734
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,189
I got this friend,
and he's really...

735
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,566
Well, he's really
a vampire, I guess.

736
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,153
It's not a good scene.
It's a bad scene,
and tomorrow I'm on a bus.

737
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,363
I'm outta here.

738
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,532
Wow. Are you okay?

739
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,201
No, I'm fine. Um...
You sure?

740
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,869
It doesn't hurt.

741
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,372
Okay.

742
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,417
Who are you?

743
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,128
I'm sorry, but you seem
like such a flake.

744
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,297
And I mean that
in a good way really.

745
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,092
It's just, you know, hey,
I can keep talking until
you strike me dead or not.

746
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,387
I prefer not.
Things are
kinda confusing.

747
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,055
I'll buy that.

748
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,810
Three weeks ago,
all I could think about was...

749
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,937
I didn't actually
think about anything,

750
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,856
but I definitely
didn't expect this.

751
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:14,860
You know what it's like
when everything
is suddenly different?

752
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:21,116
And everything
you thought was crucial
seems... Seems so stupid.

753
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,327
[Scoffs]
You find yourself

754
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,290
babbling incoherently
to a strange man
in your living room.

755
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,340
Are you calling me a man?

756
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,601
Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

757
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,813
If you want, um, to stay,

758
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,107
you can stay
in the guest room.

759
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,277
Nah. I'll stay right here.

760
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,654
Make sure the sun comes up
and everything.

761
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,657
Okay.

762
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,787
I know what it's like.

763
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,916
Hmm.

764
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,714
You fool.

765
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,635
You left the others behind
because of a little thing
like this

766
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,762
on their first kill.

767
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,640
He took my arm.

768
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,143
It was your own fault.

769
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,729
Reckless imbecile.

770
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:38,735
The City of Angels
is ours for the taking,
but you...

771
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,487
1,200 years old...

772
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,615
You behave like a child.

773
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,952
I had him in my grasp.

774
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,830
Cheer up.

775
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,748
You may still.

776
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,086
Do something about that arm.
It looks horrible.

777
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,132
Honestly, I don't know
how you made it
through the Crusades.

778
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,927
I'll be in my chamber...

[Hisses]

782
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,442
And now they found
Cassandra's body
in the hills.

783
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,445
I know. It'd been
there for weeks.
All icky.

784
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,238
It's awful.
It's awful.

785
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,074
She still had my jacket.
[Gasps]
The yellow leather?

786
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,578
You didn't get
that back from her?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

787
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,164
[Kimberly]
I loved that jacket.

788
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,458
They're having some kind
of memorial service
or something tomorrow.

789
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,251
You goin'?
I don't know.

790
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,044
Coach says I gotta
work on my abs.

791
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,964
Oh, gotta get some...
Whoa!

793
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,512
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry.

794
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,890
I'm sorry!
I don't actually
need any right now.

795
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,059
Hey, what is it with you?
Don't grab me, okay?

796
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,605
Absolutely.
I see now the error
of my mistake.

797
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,734
Hey, keep your hand
off my "thang."
I'll pop you one.

798
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,905
Did he scare you?
I can take care
of myself, all right?

799
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,991
So I noticed.
[Andy]
Yo, Jeff.

800
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:11,286
[Scoffs]
It's nice to feel needed.
[Clears Throat]

801
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,705
Let's move out!
Yes!

802
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,708
I've missed
three practices already.

803
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,669
If I'm not at that
game tomorrow, everybody's
gonna start talking.

804
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,963
It's just
another distraction.
It isn't right.

805
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,341
[Sighs]
Why, because it isn't my fate?

806
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,176
It isn't in The Book
of All Knowledgefulness

807
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,637
that I'm gonna be cheering
at the Riverview game
tomorrow?

808
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,013
Lighten up, Merrick.

809
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,599
None of the other girls
ever gave me this much
trouble.

810
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,769
And where are they now? Hello.

811
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,234
Therefore,
if we all work together,
together it'll all work out.

812
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,736
Are you with me?
Now get out there!

813
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,988
All right!
Score some, uh, points.

814
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,782
Hey, wait.
You missed practice
again today.

815
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,868
I think you better sit down
and think about how
that made me feel.

How funky is your chicken?

How funky is your chicken?

823
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,597
How loose is your goose?

824
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,683
Our goose is totally loose

This is it. You're in.

831
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,244
And remember,
you're special.

832
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,747
Thanks.
All right! Assert
your personhood.

More polite! More polite!

837
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,305
Stagger them
with your politeness.

838
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:58,184
I'm open! Grueller, I'm open!

839
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,690
Aha!
That'll show 'em.

[Cheering]

841
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,946
Coach, we can't have this.
That's not right.
We gotta get him out.

842
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,823
It is reprehensible,
but the points
count, right?

843
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,241
Get him out.
Yeah. Okay.

844
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,661
[Snarls]
Ugh!

845
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,956
Take it, man.

846
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,627
Grueller? No.

847
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,337
Will you go get him out?

848
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,175
Aha!

849
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,637
Grueller's pretty much
abandoned the concept
of zones.

855
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,996
Yeah, the gearbox...
Hah! [Laughs]

856
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,415
Hey, Eric.
Must be halftime.
[Grunts]

857
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,044
Oh! Hey, babe, You wanna
get some real power
between your legs?

858
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,879
[Growling]
[Buffy]
Yeah, I do.

859
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,673
[Groans]
[Motorcycle Revs]

860
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,509
Dyke! You're a dyke!

861
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,636
[Laughing]
I'm telling the world!

862
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,056
[Bikers Laughing]

863
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,557
[Panting]

864
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,482
[Buffy]
Grueller! Grueller!

865
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,818
Come on!

866
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,453
[Pike]
Buff!

867
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:18,366
[Groans]

868
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,411
[Creaking]

869
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,122
[Grueller]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm!

870
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,957
[Gasps, Groans]

871
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,293
Ha, ha.

872
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,878
[Groans]

873
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,505
Someone get an ouchy?

874
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,675
Grueller, it's me.
Remember me? Buffy.

875
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,178
We used to hang.
My birthday party?

876
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,431
You drank all the
blueberry schnapps and
looged on my mom?

877
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,726
[Snarling]
You were my friend.

878
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,187
Now I'm a god.

879
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,355
[Grunts]
[Groans]

880
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,067
[Thud]
[Groans]

881
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,196
And now you're a coatrack.

882
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,948
[Grunting]
Oh!

883
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,284
Geek.

884
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,786
[Snarling]
Ooh! Here we go!

885
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,165
[Groaning]

886
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,715
Look! Air.
Huh? [Groans]

887
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,763
[Vampire Groans]

888
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,849
Hi.
Hi.

889
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:29,437
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm saving your butt.

890
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:31,815
Well, there was sort of
an exchange of butts.

891
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,858
At least I didn't faint.

892
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:38,029
Pike, you shouldn't
have come back.

893
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,615
What am I gonna do, run?

894
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,325
[Chuckling]
Where am I gonna go?

895
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,870
These guys are everywhere,
and I wanna do some damage.

896
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:47,664
I'm good with damage.

897
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,582
I better find Merrick.

898
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,679
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

899
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,186
I know that guy.
That is a bad guy.
Can we go, please?

900
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,522
[Lothos]
Has our time
finally come?

901
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,275
Have you ripened so fast?

902
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,318
Come closer.

903
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:19,946
Look at me.

904
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,742
Does anybody here have
a problem with this but me?

905
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,160
[Hisses]

906
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,998
[Heartbeat Pounding]

907
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,669
Come into my eyes. Yes?
[Pike] Hey.

908
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,132
Hello!

909
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,758
This is not
a caring nurturer.

910
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,803
This guy's
a bloodsucking fiend
from beyond the grave.

911
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:47,682
Will you be wagging
that jaw of yours
while I'm biting it off?

912
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,435
Are you addressing I?

913
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,896
[Lothos]
Who's ready to stop me?

914
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,024
It's not you, Merrick.

915
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,735
You finally
brought me someone real,

916
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,988
but is she ready?

917
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,866
Actually, she's quite
a pain in the ass.

918
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,994
What a pity.
[Pike]
Your move, Merrick.

919
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,830
Come on, lefty.

920
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:14,250
You remember what happened
the last time
you messed with me.

921
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,793
I remember.

922
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,503
Shit!

923
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,297
Aaah!

924
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,090
[Groans]

925
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,509
She's not ready
for you, Lothos.

926
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,470
That's too bad.

927
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,431
I had such high hopes.

928
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,516
Close your eyes.

929
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:33,978
No!

930
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,521
Not this one!

931
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,191
Lothos.

932
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,652
[Grunts]

933
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,153
[Groans]

934
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,450
Ashes to ashes.

935
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,581
[Gurgles]

936
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,709
Oh, look.

937
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,878
Look what I've done.

938
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,839
Aw. [Sobs]

939
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,549
Dust to dust.

940
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,386
We're leaving.

941
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,055
We're not eating?
She's not ready.

942
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,432
[Groaning]

943
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:16,187
Oh.
Stay still.

944
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,647
I am still.

945
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,483
[Groans]
I'll get some help.

946
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,901
[Coughs]

947
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,115
You...

948
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:33,413
You do everything wrong.
[Chuckles]

949
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,000
Sorry.
No.

950
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,419
I take it back.
[Chuckling]
No.

951
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,588
Do it wrong.

952
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,843
Don't play our game.

953
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,763
Lothos is a...

954
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,433
is a show.

955
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,602
Remember
about the music.

956
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,438
Listen.

957
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,276
When the music stops,

958
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,571
the rest is...

959
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:11,701
Merrick?

960
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,786
Merrick!

961
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,039
Oh.

962
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:06,214
It really was mondo bizarro.
Oh, please.

963
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,549
When she ran out
into the court in the
middle of the game,

964
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:10,551
wasn't it the most
out-of-it thing ever,
or did I blink?

965
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,720
No. Way mental.

966
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,101
Oh, hi, Buffy.
Hi, guys.

967
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,187
You were supposed
to be here at 3:00.

968
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,898
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

969
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,942
Buffy, what
is your sitch?

970
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,027
You're acting like
the thing from another
tax bracket.

971
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,362
It's too weird.

972
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,240
Listen, a lot's been
going on, guys, okay?

973
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,118
And I really wanted
to talk to you
guys about it.

974
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,122
See, um...

975
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,416
A couple of weeks ago
I met this guy.

976
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:45,128
Oh, my God.
You're having an affair?

977
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,255
Cool!
Does Jeffrey know?

978
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,883
It's not about that.

979
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,261
He's, like, old. He's 50.

980
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,638
[Together]
Ew!

981
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,598
Sick!
[Jennifer]
Gross!

982
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:01,477
Haven't you guys noticed
what's been going on here?

983
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:02,728
The strange things?

984
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:07,233
Haven't you noticed
people disappearing,
turning up dead?

985
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,943
What are you
talking about?

986
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,321
Weird? You mean
like hanging out
with that homeless Poke?

987
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,574
Pike.

988
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,576
[Gasps]

989
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,495
Ew! You're having
an affair with him?

990
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,205
He doesn't look 50.

991
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,291
Guys, I think reality
stepped out of here

992
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,711
about five minutes ago.
[Kimberly]
Oh, thank you very much.

993
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,881
Yeah, like you've
got a grip.
You're so out of it.

994
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,967
Jennifer says you've
blown off cheerleading
and now dance committee?

995
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,636
Excuse me for having
something important to do.

996
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,139
And this
isn't important?

997
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,974
This happens
to be the dance.

998
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,976
[Buffy]
Right. It's a dance.

999
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,230
It's a stupid dance
with a bunch of stupid people
that I see every stupid day.

1000
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,442
[Scoffs]
Like, now we're,
like, stupid?

1001
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,862
You know, Buffy,
this doesn't happen
to be just any dance.

1002
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:56,115
It happens to be
the last dance
of our last year.

1003
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,034
Except for the semiformal.

1004
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,869
Right.
Oh, and the totally formal.

1005
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,830
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, and the senior prom.

1006
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:07,001
Okay! Look, Buffy,
if you wanna play house
with the unwashed masses,

1007
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,212
that's fine,
but personally,

1008
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,589
I think you should
spend a little
time prioritizing.

1009
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,467
I really do.
Yeah, what language
are you speaking?

1010
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,552
Get out of my facial.

1011
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,433
[Nicole]
Well...
[Scoffs]

1012
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,560
I guess you got
what you came for.

1013
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,731
Nic.
[Nicole]
Later for it.

1014
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,399
[Departing Footsteps]

1015
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,193
Jen.

1016
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,166
Buff!

1017
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,087
Hey, Buff, whatcha
been doing? I've been
looking all over for you.

1018
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,798
I'm going shopping.
Don't try and
stop me, okay?

1019
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,300
Cool. I need
some Allen wrenches.
What do you need?

1020
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,177
Dress.
For what?

1021
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,680
Dance.
Come again?

1022
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,140
I'm going
to the senior dance.

1023
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,685
Second word
sounds like "dance."

1024
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,689
I'm going to the dance.
For what?

1025
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,942
In order to dance,
drink punch,
be with my friends.

1026
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,278
¿ Comprende?
No, I don't comprende.

1027
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,322
Here the world is under attack
by legions of the undead...

1028
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:21,993
You're going to a mixer.
It's not a mixer.
It's a senior dance.

1029
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,954
It's important.
You wouldn't understand.
No, I wouldn't understand!

1030
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,622
I thought you wanted
to kill vampires.

1031
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't want
to kill anybody.

to talk about this anymore.

What about Merrick?
Is that what he'd want?
Merrick's dead.

1034
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,300
Cheap shot.

1035
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,885
He's dead because of me.

1036
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,388
Because I couldn't
lift a hand
against Lothos.

1037

You are the chosen guy.
Right.

I'm the Chosen One,
and I choose
to be shopping.

1042

01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,706
But they really...

1379
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,126
They really didn't have time
to implement it, you know,
and...

1380
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,545
I... Are we live?

1381
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,506
I felt something was wrong,

1382
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,426
so we really got out of there
before...

1383
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,846
I mean, I heard stuff.
We were nearby
when we heard...

1384
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,224
[Sobbing]
I can't believe I let you
do that to me!

1385
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,648
Details are still sketchy

1386
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,776
as to exactly who
is responsible,

1387
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,611
gang members, cultists.

1388
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,489
Everyone seemed to see
something different.

1389
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,950
This is Liz Smith
in Los Angeles.

[Woman]
I admit you got
the biggest brown eyes

1394
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:46,688
And you know
how to bite your lips
to tantalize

1395
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:51,109
Sure
Yeah

1396
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:55,822
You can get any girl
you want goin'
and you do it

1397
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:59,367
And don't say
you don't know,
'cause you do

1398
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,748
Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

1399
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:10,211
I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

1400
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:14,257
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

1401
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,092
So quit it

1402
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,724
I love you, I love you

1403
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,894
But you ain't gonna
cheat on me

1404
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:30,940
I need you, I need you
I do, boy

1405
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:38,781
Choose
Is it her or me?

1406
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,660
Yeah

1407
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,123
Just 'cause
I have a say input

1408
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:52,545
You should be ashamed
of what I've been seeing

1409
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,256
Damn
Yeah

1410
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,093
You better watch your step
or, boy, you're gonna lose

1411
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:03,848
The best thing
you ever had

1412
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,975
Oh, oh

01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:18,237
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,989
So quit it

1417
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,492
Oh, whoa
