1
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,877
NEWSCASTER: Here in Malaysia,

2
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,087
there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria,

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,131
as the newly-elected prime minister

4
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,884
has given this impoverished nation
the gift of hope,

5
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,595
promising to raise
the substandard minimum wage

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,722
and end child labor once and for all.

7
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,849
Already considered a living saint,

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,351
he has become this small country's
greatest hope,

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,312
for a thriving future
in the new millennium.

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,233
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Get closer, Jaco.

11
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,904
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?

12
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,908
JACO MUGATU: I have
negotiated my butt off, Giorgio.

13
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,745
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

14
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,374
I mean, they love that crap in Malaysia,
but he won't budge.

15
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,502
WOMAN: Listen, 50% of my inventory

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,421
is manufactured in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

17
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,256
Something has got to be done.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,884
MAN: If Malaysia goes, what is next?

19
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,929
My entire panty line is made in Vietnam.

20
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,806
We'll all go bankrupt within a year.

21
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,017
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,522
What? No, I don't have time for this.

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,940
WOMAN 2: Perhaps you'd rather go back

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,734
to turning out novelty neckties
in Hackensack.

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,070
But my new fall line is almost due.

26
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,573
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line, as well?

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,866
(WHIMPERS)

28
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,203
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,288
Do it then.

30
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,834
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

31
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,962
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.

32
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,006
That's not enough time. It takes
months to train an operative.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,176
What about Fabio? Hmm?

34
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:21,390
Too smart. This is a rush job.
He's got to be extremely dim-witted.

35
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,477
- You know the profile, Jacobim.
- WOMAN: A beautiful, self-absorbed,

36
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,856
simpleton who can be manipulated
and molded like Jell-O.

37
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,774
Or cookie dough.

38
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,360
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.

39
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:40,242
The point is, we need an empty vessel,
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,995
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

41
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,496
But who?

42
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,832
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness,

43
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,335
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,841
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

45
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,009
DEREK: Cool.

46
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,595
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?

47
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,471
DEREK: I guess it would have to be

48
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,724
the first time
I went through the second grade.

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,102
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal,

50
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,272
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.

51
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,609
- "Maybe you could do that for a career. "
- Do what?

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,612
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.

53
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,406
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

54
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,826
DEREK: Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

55
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,369
What's that look like?

56
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,124
That's impressive.

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,920
And then there's Ferrari and Le Tigre.

58
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,256
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalogue look.

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,343
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,098
(CALL ME PLAYING)

61
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,648
Look, without Derek Zoolander,

62
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,025
male modelling wouldn't be
what it is today.

63
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,735
He is a fashion icon.

64
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,154
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks,

65
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,614
thinking about them?

66
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,993
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

67
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,080
"Magnum"? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

68
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,416
Are you kidding?
I shouldn't even be talking about it.

69
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,085
It's nowhere near ready.

70
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:18,257
It's almost like there's a light
around him. He exudes beauty.

71
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,384
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.

72
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,386
Derek, I don't know if you're familiar

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,554
with the belief that
some aboriginal tribes hold.

74
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,600
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

75
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,810
What are your thoughts on that,

76
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,562
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?

77
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,192
MAN: That Blue Steel look he does?
Oh, my gosh! The style and the hair.

78
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,613
You know, it's almost like the new afro
for the white man, but it's beautiful.

79
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,033
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

80
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,954
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modelling?

81
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,331
REPORTER: Ladies and gentlemen,

82
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,791
welcome to the fashion industry's
biggest night,

83
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,042
the VH1 Fashion Awards.

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,466
There he is,
three-time Male Model of the Year,

85
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,218
Derek Zoolander.

86
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,636
He's like music.

87
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,096
REPORTER: Proud owner ofBlue Steel,

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,307
the look that made him
the legend he now is.

89
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,350
He's almost too good-looking.

90
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,601
Hey, Paco!

91
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:17,399
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

92
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,951
REPORTER: And that's who

93
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,911
Derek Zoolander is defending
his title against tonight.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,789
Hansel.

95
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,250
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.

96
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,753
The rookie sensation
who has burned his way

97
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,921
into the eye sockets
of the fashion world,

98
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,257
and left them clawing
their faces for more.

99
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,094
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!

100
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,431
Mugatu uses slave labor!

101
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,934
Down with Mugatu!

102
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,063
REPORTER: You hate to see something
like that at an event like this.

103
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,982
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.

104
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,778
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers

105
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,198
to make his, and most
of the garment industry's, clothes.

106
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,493
- Derek! Derek!
- Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

107
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,871
You're going for your fourth straight
Male Model of the Year award tonight.

108
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,414
Come on. Are you nervous?

109
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,541
Well, there are couple of
little butterflies in my basket,

110
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,126
but I think I'm doing okay.

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,462
We also hear you're working on
a new look. Can you tell us about it?

112
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,965
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

113
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,009
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...

114
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,636
Shut, baby, shut!

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,846
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

116
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,556
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?

117
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,893
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.

118
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,397
Maury, you've handled every important
male model for the last 30 years.

119
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,732
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.

120
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,860
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.

121
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,988
I'm shvitzing like a shmendrick
with all these lights.

122
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,375
Derek! Derek!
Are you worried about Hansel?

123
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,045
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.

124
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,215
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.

125
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,008
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

126
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,803
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

127
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,931
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

128
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,224
Time magazine.

129
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,601
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases

130
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,979
- for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.

131
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,439
Why don't you let him
speak for himself?

132
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,108
Isn't it true you'd like to see
the prime minister out of power

133
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,235
so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian labor?

134
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,072
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog, too!

135
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,366
- Look out! She's got an egg!
- (DOG YELPS)

136
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,577
PROTESTER:
Oh, my God! Let go of me!

137
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,078
Yes!

138
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,205
Yes.

139
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,040
Wow.

140
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,294
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me,

141
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,880
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

142
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,716
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

143
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,552
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.

144
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,970
I hear you, Jaco.

145
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,931
What this, the Slashie, mean,

146
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,518
is you consider me
the best actor slash model,

147
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,854
and not the other way around.

148
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,650
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

149
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,570
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

150
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,990
All right, now to the important stuff.

151
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,534
These ain't no slashes, folks.

152
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,286
These are the pure breeds.

153
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,998
Here are the nominees
for Male Model of the Year.

154
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,001
COMMENTATOR:
Young, hot, brash.

155
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,880
With more covers in his first year
than any rookie model ever

156
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,509
and an attitude that says,
"Who cares? It's only fashion. "

157
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,220
That Hansel's so hot right now.

158
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,307
HANSEL: I hear a lot ofwords
like "beauty" and "handsomeness,"

159
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,017
and "incredibly chiseled features. "

160
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,978
To me, that's like a vanity,
a self-absorption,

161
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,231
that I try to steer clear of.

162
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,359
I dig the bungee.
For me, it's just the way I live my life.

163
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,028
I grip it and I rip it.
I live it with a lot of flair.

164
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,906
I live it on the edge, where I gotta be.

165
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,327
I wasn't like every other kid,
who dreams about being an astronaut.

166
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:02,249
I was always more interested in
what bark was made out of on a tree.

167
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,044
Richard Gere's

00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,533
I want you to relax

507
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,620
and breathe deeply.

- Of course you do.

00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,058
Hello.

Nothing to worry about at all.

Just relax.

519
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,712
Hey there, Derek.
My name is Lil' Kleatus.

520
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,341
I'm just a kid who wants you to know
the real truth about child labor laws.

521
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,469
- Okay?
- Okay.

522
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,597
They're silly and outdated.
In the good old days,

523
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,808
kids as young as five
could work as they pleased,

524
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,853
from textile factories to iron smelts.

525
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,938
Yippee! Hooray!

526
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,068
But today, the age-old right
of children to work is under attack.

527
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,322
From the Philippines to Bangladesh,
in China and India,

528
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,324
and South America, too.

529
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,658
Boo-hoo!

530
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,453
But you can help these children, Derek,

531
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,498
by killing the prime minister of Malaysia.

532
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,666
- He is bad.
- What?

533
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,836

Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities.

and kill the Malaysian prime minister!

and your spiky black hair. Kill!

What, are you having a whack attack?

I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,363
That was last Friday.

but not interested.

- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?

- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?

to fool around a little bit...

you've been missing for a week.

is tomorrow night.

come barging into people's lofts,

576
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,878
then telling them that they've been
in a day spa for a week.

579
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,885

does not revolve around you,

ruin as many people's lives,

- By the way...
- What?

With your complexion,

594
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,175
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.

What are you talking about?

It pulls back the skin on your forehead,

597

which clogs the pores.

all those NexisLexis searches,

604
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,808
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

605
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,270
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models

606

in freak accidents.

- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?

I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!

612
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,683
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel,

613
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,478
and then you sort of laid low for a while,

614
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,605
and then made your comeback...

615
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,523
It was so courageous.

616
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,776
Look, I gotta go pee,

617
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,612
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation

618
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,821
when I come back.

00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,156

627
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,099
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?

628
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,685
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.

- You're excused.

Sorry you didn't book it.

636
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,053
Oh, yeah? I've never even heard of it.

637
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,596
Me and my friends have been too busy

638
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,265
bathing off the southern coast
of St. Barts,

639
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,016
with spider monkeys
for the past two weeks.

640
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,186
Tripping on acid changed
our whole perspective on shit.

641
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:45,358
So I guess you can Dere-lick
my balls, cápitan.

650
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,570
